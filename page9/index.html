I hesitate to call them my favorite because Friday and Saturday put up a pretty good fight, so let's just say they're top 3.  Even though Sundays back home looked different than they do now, I still treasure my Sundays.  I've started a new tradition of making breakfast on the weekends.  It's one of the best ideas I've had.  I love breakfast.  Like love LOVE breakfast.  Hands down my favorite meal.  Lunch and dinner got nothing on breakfast.  The problem is I am usually so hungry in the morning that I can barely pour my cereal fast enough, much less spend any significant amount of time conjuring up a meal that involves turning on the stove.  But in some crazy miraculous change of events, I've found a way.  Maybe it's the promise of something extra delicious to chow down on, <em>who knows</em>.  This mouth-watering occasion is one reason that I long for Sundays and now I've added another.

        <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/03.01.2014/bridge.jpg" width="970" /> <p>Some have Spring break, we have Ski break.  Both occur in March and are all about taking a little time from school to enjoy the outdoors.  Other than that, they have nothing in common.  Spring break is swimming pools, swim suits and sun.  Ski break is snow ball fights, snow shoeing and of course, skiing.

        <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/snowshoeing.jpg" width="970" /> <p> As the days go by, I learn more and more about the Finnish culture.  I know that we've lived here for almost 6 months now, but it continues to fascinate me.  For one, Finns come alive in the winter.  It's like someone flipped a switch and everyone suddenly sprang to life.  When the days get down to 20 or below, you can see the smiles on their faces and hear the excitement in their voices.  <em>Finally</em>, they say, <em>a proper winter</em>!  They use words like <em>fresh</em> to describe freezing temperatures.  I guess when winter takes up a majority of the year, you learn to embrace it.  No, they don't embrace it, they <em>thrive</em> off it.  All year they are waiting until the conditions are right for skiing, ice hockey, skating, ice fishing and all their other favorite winter activities.  They will tell you that the best sauna is the one when you can take a break from the heat to roll around in the snow (with no clothes on).  Now, I don't want to make any over-generalizations about the entire population.  I have met a Finn that wasn't a fan of winter, but I'd say those are few and far between.  Most of the time, you will find them enjoying the outdoors during these snow-covered days.   </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/snowshoeing_trees.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/showshoeing_wheatgrass.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/people_frozenlake.jpg" width="970" /></div>

Maybe that's why I haven't posted in a while.  Not because we've been in hibernation (as I predicted in my last post), it has been quite the opposite actually, I think it's because we're really getting settled in now.  We have routines, schedules, and everything feels so normal now.  Like this is our home.  </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.10.2014/branches.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.10.2014/bridge.jpg" width="970" /></div>
