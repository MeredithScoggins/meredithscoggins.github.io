<p>On our first full day in Joensuu we gave ourselves a little tour of our new town.  First, we took a look around the super market.  You will not guess what they had!!  Tex-Mex brand galore! Tortillas, salsa and guacamole in a jar!  We’re going to be alright after all.</p>

<p>Next stop, the shopping center aka the mall.  You know I had to check it out.  We just did some window shopping, but then we saw Marimekko.  (Side note: Marimekko is everywhere.  Scarfs, pillows, backpacks, even our cups and napkins on the plane.)  So we went in to see what all the fuss was about.  That’s when it happened.  It was bound to happen sooner or later, but I was not prepared for it.  The saleswoman looked straight at me and said “hjgdhsajkdslhs”.  At least that’s what I heard.  I froze.  Not froze in the sense I couldn’t remember what to say in Finnish so I responded in English (or even Spanish), no I just froze completely.  My body stopped moving and I just looked at her like a deer in headlights.  No words coming out of my mouth.  Finally, after what seemed like some veeeerrrry long seconds, she realized I wasn’t going to respond and said “Do you speak English?”  So many celebrations going on in my head – I know those words!!  My lips unfroze and said “Yes!”.</p>

<p>On our way back to our hotel we stopped at a coffee shop.  You know the rumor is that Finns drink more coffee than people anywhere else in the world.  Well it’s true.  I mean, AlLL DAY LONG.  On the train to Joensuu, it’s 4 pm and people are buying coffee like it’s going out of style.  At dinner.  Walking around the city mid-day.  Everywhere, all the time.  We’ve decided that the Finnish motto is “It’s 8 am somewhere”.</p>

<p>A piece of advice: When traveling, do not take more suitcases than you have hands.  Reasons: 1) You will look like the stereotypical American with too much stuff, 2) You will stand up for a four hour train ride because your luggage doesn’t fit in the overhead bins, 3) You will take two trips from the train station to your hotel to transport all your bags.</p>

<p>You know in the movies when someone is chasing someone else in the train station?  The pursuer is on one side of the train tracks and the pursuee is on the other.  Then the train comes.  The pursuer stares at the other side, where the pursuee was standing, and as soon as the train passes the person has vanished.  Well when we were moving all of our six bags and two backpacks across to the other side of the train tracks, that was the scenario.  Since it is impossible to carry more bags than you have hands, Scott is taking two bags at a time down the stairs, through the underground tunnel, and up the other stairs to our platform.  My job is to watch the two bags that he leaves there when he comes back to get two more.  Then a train comes.  In my head I am yelling at Scott to walk faster through the tunnel.  My heart is racing.  I am sending daggers with my eyes through the train to the spot where the bags were, in hopes that will deter them from disappearing, like on the movies.  And it worked.  The bags were magically still in the same spot when the train passed.  Lesson learned: pack light.</p>

<p>On another note, there are a lot of trees in Finland.  I mean like more than I’ve ever seen before.  I did some serious tree-staring on the train ride to Joensuu.</p>
