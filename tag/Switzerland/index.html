My idea of the perfect honeymoon had always been a relaxing week on the beach, laying out in the scorching sun with little umbrellas in my drinks.  But since our recent move forced us pretty far north in the world we felt like a warm beach was just too far away for a December trip, so we decided to embrace the winter.  Our minds were made up when Scott found an advertisement for a hotel wih an infinity pool looking out over the Swiss Alps - sign me up!  It really was everything we imagined (from the picture).  Skiing/snowboarding, a wintry hike and lots and lots of pool time.  

Our journey began when our Finnish speaking skills failed us, yet again, and we were forced to walk to the train station in the snow/ice.  An hour pulling/pushing/dragging luagge through the ice qualified as my exercise for the rest of the year.  I was not a happy camper, starting from about three minutes in.  From there it took us a train, a plane, <em>another</em> train (with one transfer), and a bus to get us to this quaint Swiss town, but it was so worth it.  (I'd probably still be at the train station without Scott's supreme navigating skills).  The people in Adelboden were so friendly and everyone spoke English (small victories).  

In retrospect maybe skiing, with it being Scott's first time and on some pretty narrow/steep slopes, was not the best honeymoon activity.  (The Swiss definition of <em>easy</em> was a little different than ours).  We spent our first day with me trying really hard to be a good and patient snow board instructor and Scott not really feeling like I was succeeding at that.  Then I took a pretty serious tumble which left me partially crippled the rest of the trip.  At least these will be stories to entertain our children with some day.  </p>
