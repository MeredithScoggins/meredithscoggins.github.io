<p>After our exciting encounters with the mountains via snowboards, we spent our last full day exploring them on something a little more familiar.  There was a hiking trail near our hotel that took us to see some pretty mesmerizing views.  We first walked through the cutest neighborhood that I&#39;m convinced we&#39;ll live in some day (just like every other place we visit).  The houses all had names written on them and they all looked like they would have the <em>perfect</em> fire place inside.  Towards the end of our hike it started to snow.  Much to our surprise, Switzerland was warmer than what we are used to in Finland, so the snow was a welcomed treat.</p>

<p>Two important things that we learned: everyone in Switzerland is trilingual (at least where we were), so we&#39;ve really got to step up our game.  Also, I learned that you should be really sure that an egg is boiled before you try to crack it (<em>important life lessons</em>).  Our first morning at breakfast I made it pretty clear to everyone around me that I had yet to learn this lesson.  I was really sure that this egg was boiled, <em>why would you serve an un-boiled egg???</em>  So I tried to crack it.  It was really hard and wouldn&#39;t crack on the table.  So I squeezed with all my might.  And then it cracked.  All. Over.  All over my shirt, all over my pants, all over the floor and all over my food.  It was quite a scene.  Needless to say, I avoided the eggs for the remainder of the trip.  </p>

<p>All in all Switzerland was pretty amazing.  I could have stared at those mountains all day.  We were so lucky to get to spend our honeymoom amongst them.    </p>

<p>My idea of the perfect honeymoon had always been a relaxing week on the beach, laying out in the scorching sun with little umbrellas in my drinks.  But since our recent move forced us pretty far north in the world, we felt like a warm beach was just too far away for a December trip, so we decided to embrace the winter.  Our minds were made up when Scott found an advertisement for a hotel wih an infinity pool looking out over the Swiss Alps - sign me up!  It really was everything we imagined (from the picture).  Skiing/snowboarding, a wintry hike and lots and lots of pool time.  </p>

<p>Our journey began when our Finnish speaking skills failed us, yet again, and we were forced to walk to the train station in the snow/ice.  An hour pulling/pushing/dragging luagge through the ice qualified as my exercise for the rest of the year.  I was not a happy camper, starting from about three minutes in.  From there it took us a train, a plane, <em>another</em> train (with one transfer), and a bus to get us to this quaint Swiss town, but it was so worth it.  (I&#39;d probably still be at the train station without Scott&#39;s supreme navigating skills).  The people in Adelboden were so friendly and everyone spoke English (small victories).  </p>

<p>In retrospect maybe skiing, with it being Scott&#39;s first time and on some pretty narrow/steep slopes, was not the best honeymoon activity.  (The Swiss definition of <em>easy</em> was a little different than ours).  We spent our first day with me trying really hard to be a good and patient snow board instructor and Scott not really feeling like I was succeeding at that.  Then I took a pretty serious tumble which left me partially crippled the rest of the trip.  At least these will be stories to entertain our children with some day.  </p>
