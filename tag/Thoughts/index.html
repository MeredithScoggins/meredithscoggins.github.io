<p>The other day I was walking home from the supermarket and I glanced down at my very worn in boots that had become soaked by the rain, and all of the sudden a thousand memories flooded my mind.  Memories of the places that they&#39;ve taken me, both the incredible and the tough times that they&#39;ve seen, and all the stories that they could tell came rushing towards me faster than I could process. Traveling has forced me to make purposeful decisions about my clothes, taking into account their flexibilty amongst different seasons, practicality, comfort, and style.  When I got home and put my boots away in the closet I took a quick scan of my clothes to see if anything else stood out to me as particularly meaningful.  When I did, I noticed that there were several key pieces in my wardrobe that I continue to reach for again and again no matter where we are.         </p>

<p><br>
<div class="image">
    <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Clothes" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-2.jpg" />
    <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Clothes" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-1.jpg" />
</div>
<br></p>

<p>As you can see by the pictures, these pieces have been very loved over time.  They&#39;re faded, they have stains, tears, and small rips, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from wearing them regularly.  In the past, as soon as my clothes got a stain or small tear I would toss them to the side and find something else to replace them, but now I see what a waste that was.  It&#39;s the ones with imperfections that are the guardians of the stories and cherished memories.  </p>

<p>When I look at my water-stained boots with worn in toes, I am reminded of those first few months after we arrived in Finland and I quickly realized that my Texas wardrobe was not going to cut it in the fridgid north.  So I sought out to find something that would keep my feet warm and be comfortable enough to wear on a regular basis (before I was forced to wear snow boots full-time) and I finally found some that fit the bill. I stressed over that first scratch, trying to diguise it and erase it from sight.  Now, after countless scratches and stains, each new one only adds character and a new chapter to their story.  Those boots felt the first snow of our first winter in Joensuu, they collected crumbs while I indulged in countless mouth-watering pastries in Paris, they protected me from the fierce winds on the Irish coast, and now they carry me the two blocks to school everyday in Chile.           </p>

<br></p>

<p>But this post is not really about my shoes, or any of my clothes for that matter, it&#39;s about the stories that they hold deep in their fabrics.  I&#39;ve always been one that loves to drag out the old family albums to reminisce and relive old memories.  I think that&#39;s why photography speaks to me so much, it allows me to capture those moments in time, happy or sad, and feel them no matter how much time has past.  It&#39;s the stories that I really cherish, and my boots are just a reminder to keep pursuring memories.  Sometimes I lose sight, but I know that in the end it&#39;s the stories that will last, not the stuff.  So this is just a reminder to myself, <em>keep pursuring memories, you won&#39;t regret it.</em></p>

<p><br>
<strong><em>What brings back those cherished memories for you?</em></strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I’m naturally a pretty quiet person (though some might say otherwise).  I love going out and spending time with my friends, but I also love quiet time at home.  My entire life I’ve been labeled “the quiet one”.  When I was younger I frequently got asked, <em>“Do you speak?”</em> by people I didn’t know well.  I started to really hate that about myself.  I felt like it was a hurdle I had to overcome if I ever wanted to be successful.  Then the summer before my senior year in college I decided to study abroad in Spain.  I intentionally did not go through my university; instead I went with an outside program where I wouldn’t know anyone.  In some ways it was a test.  <em>Can you do this?  What will you do when you have no one to hide behind?  How will you get by without your safety net of friends?</em>  Needless to say, it was quite the shock at first.  But I adapted, and eventually it became a whole lot easier.  I passed the test.  I think I knew all along that I would, but I needed that extra push.  Without even realizing it in the moment, I was living out the mantra that I’ve been trying to live by recently - <em>If something scares you, do it</em>.  The fear that comes from the unknown is something that I want to continue to confront, face on.  I’ve realized that I need that uncomfortableness in my life to challenge myself.  I need a little kick in the pants.</p>

<p>As I travel more and more, certain places start to remind me of other places that I’ve been.  Sometimes it’s the streets or the style of the buildings, other times it’s the specific mix of restaurants and food, or the way that people act and other subtle cultural aspects.  When things start to blur together in my head I begin to question the point of traveling.  If so many of the things are similar, especially in this very globalized world that we live in today, then what’s the point?  Is it just for the fun of it - just for the sheer thrill of getting away?  Is it just to give us an excuse to indulge in wine at lunchtime without feeling guilty about it?  Or is it just to say <em>“I’ve been there - check!”</em>?  </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, none of those reasons are bad reasons to travel.  And sometimes I do just want to get away and have a cocktail at noon.  But even when I lose sight of the reasons I travel, I know deep down that there’s a deeper purpose.  It’s not solely about the great food and spectacular sights (though they are most definitely perks).  For me, it’s about expanding my worldview by experiencing new things.  Being in a new place helps give me a fresh perspective on life.  It’s all the little things that add up and make me realize that there’s so much more to life.  There’s so much that I don’t know.  It’s in the awkward language exchanges, the daily, seemingly mundane customs, and the way that traveling forces you outside your comfort zone.  </p>

<p>No matter how many places I go, there’s always more to see and learn, and that’s why I keep going.  </p>

<p>We walked right past each other.  I felt your lively presence whiz past me.  I caught a glimpse of you out of the corner of my eye.  <em>Why didn’t you stop and say hello, dear friend?</em>  It’s been a while since we met.  We had a brief encounter last year, but it was not nearly long enough to really catch up.  <em>How have you been?  Do you still have that bright, enthusiastic smile?</em>  I always loved that about you.  Always sparking joy where ever you go.  Everyone seems to light up when you&#39;re around.  </p>

<p>I hope we can meet again soon, though it will probably be longer that I wish.  You always seem to disappear for too long.  Sometimes it may seem like I’m pushing you away, it’s just that I need a break, but just a brief one.  After a while I start to wonder if I’ve hurt your feelings and you’ve left for good.  But just when I&#39;ve almost given up hope, you come back.  You always come sneaking back, sometimes later than others.  Oh, what a joyous reunion it is!</p>

<p>This year we’ll have to be apart for longer than usual.  It’s not by choice, of course.  It’s just the way it has to be.  But don’t leave.  Please stay nearby, waiting for me, ready to greet me with open arms.  I’m going to need a big warm hug.</p>

<p>See you in 2017.</p>

<p>I’ve come a long way since my days of planning out every minute of our travels.  I think back on Scott&#39;s and my first real trip together and can feel the gravity of the change.  We went to San Francisco and I had every day mapped out to a T.  There were times when we were forced to change our plans for one reason or another, but almost every second of our days were planned out in advance.  Scott <em>finally</em> convinced me on our last day to wander around without any plans.  I was nervous, tense, confused.  <em>Well, then what are we going to do?</em>, I thought.  But I gave in because, after all, it was his vacation too.</p>

<p>I was uneasy at first.  I didn’t understand the point.  We were going to miss something!  But after a while, I started to actually enjoy it.  We wandered to a new part of the city and had an amazing meal that I still have fond memories of today.  I slowly learned to let go.</p>

<p><br>
<div class="image">
    <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Leaving Room" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.03.30+Leaving+Room+for+the+Unexpected/leaving+room.jpg" />
</div></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I’m still a planner.  I love to make lists and check things off.  I thoroughly enjoy researching each place we visit before we go.  But I’ve learned to balance the planned while still leaving room for the unexpected, because it’s in those moments that lasting memories are made.  The times when I have let the motion of the place and the moment in time guide my experience, rather than a line in my planner, have largely been times of growth.  I think that these are the times that make traveling so transformative for me.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve 2014 we were in Kemi, Finland.  We were there with the sole intention of visiting Santa (<em>the real one</em>) in Rovaniemi.  We had no expectations for Kemi.  We just happened to stay there because we booked our trip last minute and we couldn’t find any place to stay in Rovaniemi within our budget.  So it was 11:30 pm and we had just gotten off the train in Kemi.  As we walked back to our hotel, we were looking for a place to ring in the New Year.  The streets were dark, almost black, save for the blanket of snow on the ground.  As we turned the corner to our hotel we stumbled upon one of the only places that seemed to be inhabited.  The neon sign read “<em>The Old Gringo</em>”.  Let me remind you, we are in rural Finland, almost as far north as the Arctic Circle, and here we are as Texans, standing in front of The Old Gringo.  The absurdity of it all was just too much.  Let’s just say it was fate.  That New Years will forever be ingrained in my memory - the fierceness of the hugs from happy strangers, and the numerous laughs we’ve had recounting the hilarity of that moment in time still do not escape me.  </p>

<p>I hope to do this more often.  To remember the value in those moments.  And not just when I’m traveling, but in my daily life.  I want to leave room for the unexpected to happen when I’m at home, in my own city.  After all, where&#39;s the fun in already knowing everything that’s going to happen?   </p>

<p>It’s happening again.  We’re gearing up to make a cross-continental move.  This time in the opposite direction - down to the southern hemisphere.  We will be settling in Chile where I will be teaching English in a Chilean public school.  There are still many unknowns, which can occasionally lead to uneasiness, but mostly we&#39;re just really excited.  The plan is to be in Chile for about 8 months and get to know the country as best as we can while we&#39;re there.  Before we get to Chile we&#39;ll be making a week stopover in Buenos Aires to get a little taste of Argentina (think prime beef, wine and empanadas).  </p>

<p>We’ve been working through the pre-move checklist - visas, doctors, packing, and the like; and although it’s on our minds all the time, I still can’t believe it’s real.  About a year ago, when our time in Finland was winding down, in the midst of a daydream I blurted out, “What if we moved to South America for a while?”.  It was completely hypothetical and far-fetched, but then Scott responded with, “That’d be cool.”, and I started considering it.  Ultimately I decided that it would be pretty darn cool too (<em>shocker</em>).  From that moment we continued to entertain the idea until it got to the point where we were talking financials and real life plans.  And then it was settled.  We decided we were going to make it happen, one way or another.  Now here we are, after a lot of planning and even more late-night conversations, our hands are shaking but we have big smiles on our faces. Adventure awaits.      </p>

<p>When I read this quote from <a href="http://alisonsudol.com/">Alison Sudol</a> in <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/">The Great Discontent</a> recently, it really stuck with me.  Alison’s words gave life to the feeling I’ve been experiencing in this current stage of life.  Transitional, and questioning where exactly I’m headed.  I have a lot of ideas and dreams, but no clear path.  I’ve being trying out a lot of new things and discovering new interests.  Some of those things seem to have no (or very little) overlap, which makes it all confusing.  </p>

<p>I’ve been slowly sorting through these thoughts and carving out a path to follow, at least in the short term.  It’s scary because it’s so unknown.  <em>Is this how I’m supposed to start?  Are people going to think I’m crazy?  Will I come out of this thinking it was all worth it?  Or will it all blow up in my face?</em>  These are the types of questions that nag at me on a regular basis.  Then I have to remind myself to just keep moving forward.  This life is a journey and I want to be an active participant in it.  I don’t know where it’ll lead me, but that’s part of the excitement.  </p>

<p>These next couple months we will be stepping into the unknown, not having a carefully laid plan.  On the days that we question our decisions and whether we are doing the right thing, I have to remind myself that it is a process.  We’re moving forward and pursuing our dreams and the rest will come on its own.  </p>
