<p>About two weeks ago we took a week-long winter vacation and traveled in the central region of Chile.  One of our stops along the way was Valparaíso, a coastal town not too far from Santiago.  When you arrive in Valparaíso it is as if you have traveled to another country entirely.  It&#39;s unlike anywhere else I have been in Chile, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  The town is filled with quirkiness and is most known for it&#39;s abundance of street art that covers almost every building.  It&#39;s sensory overload, in the best way.  We spent our short time there just wandering around, up and down all the hills, taking it all in (<em>that and eating a lot</em>).</p>

<p>The port of Valparaíso, although less talked about, is an important part of the city&#39;s history.  In the early 1800&#39;s the city&#39;s harbour opened the possibility for international trade and was a major stopping point for ships making their way around South America.  Although the impact of the harbour has decreased over the years, you can still feel the sense of life it brings to the city from its shores.  We got up early one morning to watch the boats coming and going and got to be a part of the awakening of the city.  </p>

<p>It’s hard to think of a day that sounds more relaxing than soaking in a natural hot springs surrounded by autumn-colored trees and a cool breeze.  There are endless ways to expend your energy amongst the lakes and mountains in this region, so it only seems fitting that nature gives us a way to relax and unwind as well.  Last weekend we traded in our hiking gear for swimsuits and headed out to spend the afternoon at one of the many hot springs just outside of Pucón.</p>

<p>Villarrica is a great base to take advantage of pretty much everything you could want to do around here.  It’s just a short bus trip from Pucón, where you can catch buses that take you to the national parks, the volcano, and the hot springs.  We decided to go to <a href="http://www.termaslospozones.cl/">Los Pozones</a> hot springs after it was recommended to us by several people for the peaceful atmosphere it offered, tucked in a beautiful forest amongst the streams and tall trees.  </p>

<p>Some of the hot springs offer food and drinks in addition to other amenities, but this spot is kept wonderfully natural with only the springs and a changing room.  We took a short break to eat the simple lunch we packed, but other than that we spent the entire time just soaking in the crystal clear water.</p>

<br></p>

<p>The occasional cool breeze provided a welcomed balance to the steamy water throughout the day.  Although I felt like I could spend an eternity there, my body knew it needed a break after a few hours.  We reluctantly left the tranquility of the water, put our coats back on and headed back up the hill to catch the bus back to Pucón. I felt like I was in a dream as we walked up the steep incline to find the mountain tops completely engulfed in wispy clouds. With its close proximately to Villarrica, we will surely be back soon to experience another afternoon as relaxing as that one.        </p>

<p>I’ve been going about daily life here in Chile, posting every so often over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meredithspetit/">here</a> without giving you a proper introduction to our new town and life.  So let me back up a bit.</p>

<p>We arrived in Chile a little over a month ago and have been settled into our new town of Villarrica for about four weeks.  Villarrica is a mid-sized town in the center of southern Chile.  As I mentioned in my last post, Villarrica sits on a beautiful lake flanked by mountains and volcanos.  On the other side of the lake is Pucón, Villarrica’s more tourist-friendly neighbor.  The area is known for its access to nature and outdoor adventures (hiking, canoeing, hot springs, rafting, skiing, and so much more), which we are steadily working on checking off our list.</p>

<p><br>
<div class="image">

</div>
<br></p>

<p>We have made our home in Villarrica in a quaint wooden cabin, just two blocks from the lake (and less than two blocks from my school).  We are learning so many new things through our adventures in cabin life, like how to keep a fire going all day (and all night), and what to do when you run out of propane in the middle of cooking dinner on your gas stove.  Reminds me of some of the fond <a href="http://coatsandkahvi.com/2013/09/03/our-new-apartment.html">memories</a> we have figuring out life in Finland.  One of the best things about our cabin is that we have a view of the Villarrica Volcano from our porch.  Every day on my way to work I get to glance over at the ever-changing peak - sometimes clear and calm, while at other times surrounded by smoke or looming clouds.  That incredible sight never gets old.  Another thing that I love about where we are living is that we walk to everything - the supermarket, the laundry, our favorite pizza place, the lake, and my school.  It’s just one of those small joys that makes the everyday a little bit more pleasantly simple.  </p>

<p>On top of this just being a wonderful little town, everyone has also been so welcoming and kind to us.  People seem to go out of their way to help the <em>gringos</em> figure out how to do things around here.  Especially our adoptive Chilean <em>padres</em> who make sure that we get our filling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado">asado</a> every weekend and keep us stocked up on fire wood so we don’t freeze our buns off.  They&#39;ve made sure that we know what a real pisco sour tastes like and how to make the simply delicious staple, Chilean salad.  They even threw Scott a birthday party complete with fresh ceviche and Chilean wine just a few days after we arrived!  They&#39;ve played a huge role in the amazing experience we’ve had so far.    </p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that we’re already a month into this because in a lot of ways I feel like we&#39;re just getting started.  There&#39;s so much to do, so much to see and time seems to be racing past us - I wish I could hit the slowmo button and stretch out the time we have left, <em>just a little bit</em>.     </p>

</div>
<br></p>

<p>In the south of Chile, in between two charming town, sits a lake with jaw-dropping views from every angle.  Jagged mountains serve as the primary backdrop to the typically glass-like water.  Though the towering volcano with smoke looming around its peak can easily steal the show with the overwhelming sense of awe it provokes.  This lake just so happens to be located two blocks from the cabin we’re currently calling home.</p>

<p><br>
<div class="image">
    <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Lake Villarrica" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-1.jpg" />

</div>
<br></p>

<p>Though the lake remains fairly quiet during the colder months, the presently deserted kiosks, the empty black sand beach, and the single brave kayaker give us glimpses of the lively scenes that flood its shores in the summer.  While we dream of those warmer days when we can dip our feet into the pristine water, we will not let the chilly air keep us from enjoying walks along the shore, reveling in its staggering beauty.  </p>

<p><br>
<div class="image">

</div></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>There is something incredibly calming about the sight of water that seems to put everything into perspective and quiets the day-to-day anxieties that we all experience.  The massive mountains seem to tell us that our worries are not nearly as big as they feel, and encourage moments of reflection which help us re-evaluate our priorities. Though the busyness of our lives can often times discourage us from taking the time to partake in simple things that don’t produce a tangible product, such as taking a walk, I always feel more grounded after I have allowed myself to do those things.  </p>

<p>As I write this and once again realize how fortunate we are to live so close to this little oasis in southern Chile, I hope to take advantage of all that this lake offers as much as possible during our time here.     </p>
