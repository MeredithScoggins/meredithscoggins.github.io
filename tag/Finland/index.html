<p>Leading up to and following New Year&#39;s Eve we spent some time visiting two other cities in Lapland. Tornio is a small town that shares a border with the Swedish town of Haparanda. There wasn&#39;t much to do in this small town, but it was kind of fun to walk right over to Sweden. Oh and a bonus to that is we went to a Swedish IKEA (<em>score</em>). Most of the time IKEA is a nightmare because you generally go to buy one thing and you end up spending your <em>entire</em> day there due to the endless maze of a store. However, when you are in Tornio and you are wandering around trying to find something to do, preferably indoors, walking slowly through an IKEA isn&#39;t half bad. (Plus we just wanted to say we&#39;d been to an IKEA where it all began). </p>

<p>While we were there we also saw one of the oldest wooden churches in Finland, built in 1686, and went to a fake Tex-Mex restaurant. The person writing for Lonely Planet must not be from Texas because what we experienced was quite possibly the furthest thing from Tex-Mex. The jalapeño poppers weren&#39;t even spicy.  <em>What is that??</em> We actually had our first encounter with reindeer at this said Tex-Mex restaurant. After that we ate it another three times over the course of our trip in the form of, reindeer soup, reindeer burger and sautéed reindeer. I think it&#39;s safe to say that we enjoyed it. </p>

<p>Our stay in Kemi was a little more exciting (though it doesn&#39;t even come close to the huskies).  Kemi is a port town that is known for its Snow Castle and Ice Breaker ship.  Unfortunately, neither of these things were open yet. We did get to see the beginnings of the Ice Castle though, which look pretty amazing. When it&#39;s finished you can book a room inside the castle where it&#39;s like -18 degrees Celsius.  Apparently it&#39;s also a fairly popular spot for people to get married or honeymoon in the winter (if we had only known...). </p>

<p>One of the most exciting things we did while we were there was walk on the frozen sea. There was a hole in the ice about 15 feet from shore that looked man-made, so we figured it had to be safe to walk on. It was a little risky, as we could have very well fallen through the ice and frozen to death, but fortunately we lived to tell about it. </p>

<p>Our New Year&#39;s Eve plans, as usual, were left to the last minute.  (We like to live on the edge).  Joensuu was a ghost town for the Christmas break and all flights, to just about everywhere, were jacked up for the holidays.  We knew we had to get out and do something or the darkness would swallow us up (<em>and because I get really antsy</em>).  So after exhausting several options, we made the decision to travel to even more darkness and snow.  The bright side of this is that Santa would be there and he can brighten even the darkest of days, <em>right?</em>  Joulupukki, as the Finns call him, has a village that sits on the Arctic Circle, just north of Rovaniemi.  He has a post office where you can write yourself letters to be sent or have Santa himself send you one.  He has a workshop, <em>obviously</em>, where you can buy many of the trinkets that his elves make.  There&#39;s a Santa restaurant, café, and everything else you could imagine.  But the real reason that we went (don&#39;t tell Santa) is for the huskies.  These are not your average huskies.  These puppies are masters of the sleigh.  We opted for an hour long sleigh ride. When we got to &quot;Husky Park&quot; we were informed that there was a snow problem and we may not be able to go (cue extreme disappointment).  But we soon found out that one of the women working there was going to take us out, WAY out, into the woods to a family that raises and trains the dogs for our ride.  We were super pumped.  Even more so when we learned that we would be <em>leading</em> our own team of dogs.  I had imagined we would both just be along for the ride.  Little did we know Scott would be the leader (well other than the lead dogs, that is).  If that was the only thing we had done the entire time we were there, it would have been worth it.  The experience was unforgettable. The dogs were amazing.  We learned how they were trained and the different jobs each of them had on the team.  I was in awe of how good they were.  Oh, and then to top it off, we got to see some tiny husky babies. <em>I died</em>. Just about the cutest things I&#39;ve ever seen.  I apologize for the exessive amount of dog photos, but it could have been way worse.  And, I mean, if you don&#39;t like pictures of dogs, <em>what&#39;s wrong with you?</em>   </p>

<p>We made it back to Kemi just before midnight and rang in the new year at the Old Gringo.  2013 was really good to us and I have a feeling 2014 is going to be a pretty great year too. </p>

<p>After countless times passing through, we finally got to spend a little time in Helsinki.  We went straight from several days of luxury in Switzerland to two nights in the smallest apartment ever.  <em>And we thought our apartment was small.</em> The bathroom in this place could barely fit one person at a time, literally.  You could brush your teeth, use the toilet and take a shower, all at the same time.  Luckily, we didn&#39;t spend much time inside or I might have gone crazy.</p>

<p>My main objective for this trip was to visit as many Christmas markets as possible.  We hit up three and got a good fill of Christmas spirit.  Since Joensuu is not exactly a booming metropolis, we decided to get our Christmas shopping done in Helsinki.  All of the markets had various stands that sold homemade good and treats, but each one was a little bit different from the others.  Glögi, the Finnish version of mulled wine, is found everywhere around Christmas.  It&#39;s traditionally served with almonds and raisins, in the actual drink.  I was initially hesitant about nuts in my drink, but it ends up being a nice little snack when you&#39;re finished.</p>

<p>I have really loved living in and visiting some of the smaller towns around Europe.  I think it has forced me to take a look around and appreciate the little things.  It&#39;s nice to feel like we live in the middle of the forest.  Whenever I&#39;m in the city center, I always stop and think real hard about anything else I need to do/get while I&#39;m there because if I forget something, <em>well</em> it better be worth an hour long bike ride.  But I was raised in the city.  Deep down at my core, I&#39;m a city girl.  So while we were in Helsinki, this surpressed city girl in me was doing cartwheels and flips.  I loved getting to try all the fun restaurants and cafés.  I loved that no matter where we were there was a store/restaurant/market/people around us.  We went to brunch for the first time since we&#39;ve moved and it was deeeeelicious.  Oh how I miss overly priced food with fancy names.  My mouth is still watering just thinking about the mounds of food that we devoured.  It filled my compartment designated for big city things.  But truthfully, I missed Joensuu.  I was so happy to be back to our little apartment where the only thing we can hear is the loud sneezer that lives next door.  It&#39;s nice to have some quiet time too.    </p>
