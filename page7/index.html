<p>After our exciting encounters with the mountains via snowboards, we spent our last full day exploring them on something a little more familiar.  There was a hiking trail near our hotel that took us to see some pretty mesmerizing views.  We first walked through the cutest neighborhood that I&#39;m convinced we&#39;ll live in some day (just like every other place we visit).  The houses all had names written on them and they all looked like they would have the <em>perfect</em> fire place inside.  Towards the end of our hike it started to snow.  Much to our surprise, Switzerland was warmer than what we are used to in Finland, so the snow was a welcomed treat.</p>

<p>Two important things that we learned: everyone in Switzerland is trilingual (at least where we were), so we&#39;ve really got to step up our game.  Also, I learned that you should be really sure that an egg is boiled before you try to crack it (<em>important life lessons</em>).  Our first morning at breakfast I made it pretty clear to everyone around me that I had yet to learn this lesson.  I was really sure that this egg was boiled, <em>why would you serve an un-boiled egg???</em>  So I tried to crack it.  It was really hard and wouldn&#39;t crack on the table.  So I squeezed with all my might.  And then it cracked.  All. Over.  All over my shirt, all over my pants, all over the floor and all over my food.  It was quite a scene.  Needless to say, I avoided the eggs for the remainder of the trip.  </p>

<p>All in all Switzerland was pretty amazing.  I could have stared at those mountains all day.  We were so lucky to get to spend our honeymoom amongst them.    </p>

<p>My idea of the perfect honeymoon had always been a relaxing week on the beach, laying out in the scorching sun with little umbrellas in my drinks.  But since our recent move forced us pretty far north in the world, we felt like a warm beach was just too far away for a December trip, so we decided to embrace the winter.  Our minds were made up when Scott found an advertisement for a hotel wih an infinity pool looking out over the Swiss Alps - sign me up!  It really was everything we imagined (from the picture).  Skiing/snowboarding, a wintry hike and lots and lots of pool time.  </p>

<p>Our journey began when our Finnish speaking skills failed us, yet again, and we were forced to walk to the train station in the snow/ice.  An hour pulling/pushing/dragging luagge through the ice qualified as my exercise for the rest of the year.  I was not a happy camper, starting from about three minutes in.  From there it took us a train, a plane, <em>another</em> train (with one transfer), and a bus to get us to this quaint Swiss town, but it was so worth it.  (I&#39;d probably still be at the train station without Scott&#39;s supreme navigating skills).  The people in Adelboden were so friendly and everyone spoke English (small victories).  </p>

<p>In retrospect maybe skiing, with it being Scott&#39;s first time and on some pretty narrow/steep slopes, was not the best honeymoon activity.  (The Swiss definition of <em>easy</em> was a little different than ours).  We spent our first day with me trying really hard to be a good and patient snow board instructor and Scott not really feeling like I was succeeding at that.  Then I took a pretty serious tumble which left me partially crippled the rest of the trip.  At least these will be stories to entertain our children with some day.  </p>

<p>(And some pictures along the way.)  Lately we&#39;ve been transporting some abnormal things on our bikes.  Well mostly my bike because of it&#39;s awesome abilities with the basket and all.  Riding with a rug in your basket or stools on the back are a little tricky in themselves, but what makes it even more challenging is manuvering through the snow with these things.  The day that beat them all (<em>by far</em>) was the day we went to get the stools.  We decided that we needed a little more seating in our apartment and since we had people coming over the next day it seemed like the perfect time to buy some.  That day there just so happened to be a blizzard going on outside.  It seemed like as good of a day as any and the snow wasn&#39;t going to be letting up any time soon, so we just bundled up and headed out.  At first the snow is kind of enchanting, but not too far in you start to feel like tiny frozen needles are piercing your eyeballs and there couldn&#39;t be anything worse.  Except for the fact that it makes seeing almost impossible.  So we proceed to ride, eyes mostly shut, to the store.  At one point I told Scott that my eyelids would probably be frozen shut by the time we got there.  His response - just keep blinking.  After continuous blinking and an immense amount of pedaling, we arrived, both completely covered in snow but our eyes were still in tact.  An obvious progression of thought would be that our current situation makes for a perfect photo op, huh?  That&#39;s what I thought.  And Scott, after the eye rolls and sighs, reluctantly obligied.  After the picture taking, walking back to my bike, I fell (<em>karma</em>).  My first snow fall.  My feet completely came out from under me and my entire body hit the ground.  Bruised knee and all, that may have been the best part of the excursion (<em>after all, there is nothing funnier</em>).  And although the journey was completely grueling and there was a moment where I prayed a helicopter would magically appear and pick us up, when we got home with those two stools it felt like we had just climbed Mt. Everest.  We made it!  Another check off the ole bucket list.  </p>

<p>I know we&#39;re a little late, but since we don&#39;t get Thanksgiving Day off over here we decided to postpone our Thanksgiving celebration until Sunday.  It was our first year not being with family, which of course was difficult, but we wanted to make it something fun and special anyway so we had our first Friendsgiving!  We invited over some of our good friends that we&#39;ve made here in Finland, and since none of them are from the U.S. (therefore never having celebrated Thanksgiving) we had to do it right.  We spent the entire day Saturday and half of the day Sunday cooking as many traditional Thanksgiving dishes that we could manage.  Green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie...the works.  The only thing missing was the turkey.  I know, it&#39;s a pretty key piece, but the only turkey we found in Joensuu was about a million dollars, so we opted out.  And even without the turkey and our families, it turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving.  Everyone left happy and full, which to me meant that it was a success!  This year we are so thankful for our friends and family back home and for the many new friends and memories that we&#39;ve been able to make here.         </p>
