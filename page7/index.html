Ok, it’s technically a fell, but that’s a mountain by Finnish standards.  So we’re going to call it a mountain.  Anyway, we drove nearly to the top to take in the view and check out the slopes one afternoon.  As soon as we opened the car doors we were blasted with some seriously cold and incredibly strong wind.  The wind was blowing so hard that the packed snow was wildly swirling through the air pummeling anything and everything around it.  There was a café not too far away from where we parked, so we all turned around, backs facing the flying snow, and walked backwards all the way there.  You could barely see anything but a cloud of white.  Our initial intention was just to hang out outside for a while looking out over the town, but the wind was so unbelievably crazy that we cut our viewing time short.  We only went into the café to rest for minute and thaw our frozen hands (from taking pictures) before walking right back through the storm. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-1.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-3.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-4.jpg" width="970"/></div>

With the addition of our bags, we filled the car to the brim (Scott cleverly using plastic grocery bags for maximum squish-ability).  It was 6:30 am and we had almost 14 hours ahead of us before we would get to our cottage in Levi.  I was lucky enough to sit in the most coveted seat in the car, <em>back middle</em>, where any move you make you’re almost guarenteed to be touching someone else around you.  But I did have a straight shot of the open road, so there’s that. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.17+Lapland+road+trip/bridge_waterfall.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.17+Lapland+road+trip/group_waterfall.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.17+Lapland+road+trip/lapland+road+trip-4.jpg" width="970" /></div>

The winter has been good to us.  It’s given us lots of good snow and even some sunny days too!  Those days are the best.  Puts a smile on my face just thinking about them.  Except they can really fool a sun-deprived soul.  Over the weekend we had a super bright sunny day so I convinced Scott to go on a walk.  It wasn’t long after we started walking that we were reminded sun is not synonymous with warmth, not even close. </p><div class="image"> /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.02.18+Winter+happenings/20150201-_DSC8146.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.02.18+Winter+happenings/20150215-_DSC8414.jpg" width="970" /></div>

It was going to be hard to live up to our expectations because we had hyped it up so much, but it did not disappoint.  Not in the least.  In fact, I think it was even better than we imagined.  Tulum used to be a fairly tourist-free corner of Mexico, but in recent years its secret has been plastered all over the internet.  Normally, that would mean it's now overrun with giant resorts, chain restaurants and souvenir shops.  Although I don’t really know what it was like before, I’d say that it has blown up in the best way possible. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.19+Tulum%2C+Mexico/beach_papayas.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.19+Tulum%2C+Mexico/me+in+hammock.jpg" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.19+Tulum%2C+Mexico/activities+sign_scott.jpg" /> </div>
