It has a fire pit and fire wood all ready to go.  All it’s missing is some sticky marshmallows and melted chocolate.  I can see s’mores in my very near future. </p><div class="image"><img alt="in the forest" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.19.2013/_DSC0977.JPG" width="970" /><img alt="teepee" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.19.2013/_DSC0980.JPG" width="970" /><img alt="teepee" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.19.2013/_DSC1007.JPG" width="970" /></div>

I don’t have real hiking clothes.  The closest thing I have is running pants and tennis shoes.  So that’s exactly what I wore.  When we got to the bus that was going to take us to Koli, I tried asking one of the leaders about the trip (since we didn’t sign up in advance).  We were having some communication issues, due to his lack of English and my lack of Finnish, so another lady going on the trip tried to help.  This was how it went.  Lady&#58; “We are going on a hiking trip.”  Me&#58; “Yes, I know, I was wondering if it would be okay if we joined.”  Lady&#58; “Do you have clothes to wear?”  Me&#58; “Um…what I’m wearing…”  She didn’t have to say any words after that, her face said it all.  It said, “You’ve got to be kidding me, what are those pants you’re wearing??”  Then the panic set in.  After Scott convinced me that I would be ok and wouldn’t be shunned from the group, we found a guy who spoke English and made our way onto the bus. (Side note&#58; I will be buying real hiking pants soon.  Gotta fit in with the locals.)</p><div class="image"><img alt="Koli National Park" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.16.2013/_DSC0874.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Ontop of Koli" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.16.2013/_DSC0846.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Overlook" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.16.2013/_DSC0820.jpg" width="970" /></div>

Everyone all over is looking at the same moon which gives them comfort.  I’ve realized that squirrels are like that for me.  No matter where you are in the world, the chances are you will probably run across a squirrel. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Trees" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.12.2013/IMG_3958.JPG" width="970" /><img alt="Ducks" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.12.2013/IMG_3926.JPG" width="970" /></div>

        <br><img alt="University of Eastern Finland" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.10.2013/IMG_3905.JPG" width="970" /> <p> Here it is.  My first day of master's school.  Since my mom is not in Finland, Scott has taken over her duties of picture taking (he is not nearly as good, mom).  But the picture lived up to its expectations just like all the other terribly awkward and unattractive first day photos…I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I rode The Viking (that’s what we’ve named her) to school, looking very collegiate with my fiancé’s backpack on.  So far I’ve learned that class scheduling in Finland is very different than what I’m used to in the states.  Most of the classes last for only 2-3 months.  So not all of them start on the first day, I have some that start in October or November.  And there’s generally no pattern to how the lessons are scheduled.  There’s no Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday classes.  There are just random days and times.  It’s been kind of confusing and somewhat difficult to organize in the beginning, but I’m thinking (hoping) that this is the hard part.  After scheduling everything I think it’ll be nice to have my classes so spread out.

Yes, that means we’ve been sleeping on the floor.  I started thinking about when I was younger and my parents would get up from the floor moaning and groaning about their legs/back/everything hurting and how I always thought that was so ridiculous.  I mean how is it even possible for your body to hurt from just sitting on the floor?? Let me tell you, it is possible.
