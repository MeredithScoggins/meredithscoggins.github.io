<p>Hyvää Vappua! Happy May Day! We&#39;ve had quite the busy week over here celebrating.  Vappu is the second biggest holiday celebration in Finland (first being Midsummers).  I&#39;ve never seen so many people out in Joensuu – I didn&#39;t even know that many people lived here.  Although May Day is officially May 1st, the festivities ran throughout the entire week.  We started the week with the <em>flying flags</em> event at the university, where we each wrote about our experiences in Finland on the back of our country&#39;s flag.  Then we let them go together to demonstrate what the exchange students bring to Finland.  The next day we went on a bus tour of Eastern Finland.  We stopped at various places to explore and socialize, then we were back on the bus to the next stop.  On Vappu Eve there was a parade of students from the university to an island across town.  In Finland, all students have different colored jumpsuits according to their major.  They collect badges from different events that they take part in and cover their jumpsuits in them.  On special occasions (Vappu being one) all the people that have graduated from basic school (high school) wear their graduation caps proudly.  It&#39;s really a big deal to be able to show off your cap.  After the parade, people gather at the island where there is music playing and they hang out with their friends.  People continue partying wayyy into the night, since the next day is a national holiday.  On the actual day (May 1st), everyone gathers in the city center where there are vendors selling May Day balloons and streamers, a vintage car parade and plenty of socializing.  As the day goes on, people begin to make their way  to the island to have a picnic with their friends and family.  Although it wasn&#39;t exactly picnic weather, <em>I&#39;m talking 35 degrees</em>, we enjoyed spending time eating with our friends.  All the Vappuu activities may have gotten in the way of a little school work this week, but I can&#39;t miss out on the culture, right?  </p>

<p>It seems that every time I start to talk about the <em>amazzzzingly</em> wonderful weather in Finland, it comes back to haunt me.  Remember last week when I was raving about how perfect the weather was... well I take it back.  It has snowed at least three days since then.  <em>Not cool, Finland, not cool.</em>  They say that warm weather is coming, but I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.    Yesterday we spent a good amount of time outside, when it suddenly began to snow.  I looked at a Finnish guy near us with what I&#39;m sure was a “<em>you&#39;ve got to be kidding me</em>” face.  And his apt response was, “<em>It&#39;s Finland, what can I say?</em>”.  </p>

<p>Y&#39;all, it&#39;s spring in Finland!  From the day we got back it&#39;s been nothing but beautiful weather.  I&#39;m talking sunny days and warm (relatively) temperatures.  I haven&#39;t worn a scarf since we&#39;ve been back.  Yesterday my legs were exposed to the Finnish sun for the first time since September.  Okay, really it was just my ankles, but it was BIG.  It&#39;s been so nice that it&#39;s making it hard to stay inside and concentrate on school work because I just want to live outside.  Picnics are seriously calling my name.  I want to picnic every meal.  Even though this seems like a huge change from the below 30 degree weather when we left in early April, the biggest adjustment has been the sun.  Right now the sun rises before 5:00 am and sets after 9:00 pm.  Which, don&#39;t get me wrong, is amaaaaazzzing, but it&#39;s completely throwing us off.  We brought back some black out curtains because, even before we left, the sun was waking us up at 5 every morning.  They work like magic.  The only problem is it is so dark in our room that it makes waking up harder (I&#39;m still going to blame it on the jet lag though).  This weekend we slept till 11 one morning and 10 the next.  I don&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve done that.  Then the situation at night is the opposite.  It is so bright outside until about 8:45 that we don&#39;t even start thinking about dinner until at least 8:00.  The sun is turning us into the Spaniards and Greeks.  Last night we ate at 10:00!  And this is not even the most sun we will get.  In June we&#39;ll have 20 hours of sunlight!  Talk about a huge change – in December I was coming out of class at 3:00 to total darkness and now the sun is barely setting when it&#39;s time for me to go to bed.  </p>

<p>Although I will be stuck inside some, finishing up these last few weeks of school, there will be plenty of time carved out to enjoy the outdoors.  This week is Vappuu (May Day) and we have lots of fun activities planned!    </p>

<p>Sundays are pretty great days.  I hesitate to call them my favorite because Friday and Saturday put up a pretty good fight, so let&#39;s just say they&#39;re top 3.  Even though Sundays back home looked different than they do now, I still treasure my Sundays.  I&#39;ve started a new tradition of making breakfast on the weekends.  It&#39;s one of the best ideas I&#39;ve had.  I love breakfast.  Like love LOVE breakfast.  Hands down my favorite meal.  Lunch and dinner got nothing on breakfast.  The problem is I am usually so hungry in the morning that I can barely pour my cereal fast enough, much less spend any significant amount of time conjuring up a meal that involves turning on the stove.  But in some crazy miraculous change of events, I&#39;ve found a way.  Maybe it&#39;s the promise of something extra delicious to chow down on, <em>who knows</em>.  This mouth-watering occasion is one reason that I long for Sundays and now I&#39;ve added another.  </p>

<p>We ride our bikes a lot.  And although they seldom go a day without turning their wheels, they rarely get ridden for pure enjoyment.  Most of the time they are just a means of transportation.  It&#39;s such a shame.  These tired old machines never get to have any fun.  But we have vowed to change that.  A bike ride has now been added to our Sunday routine.  We decided not to wait until the sun comes out and the flowers are blooming to start because, quite frankly, that could be a while.  Today was day 1.  We rode our bikes down our mostly clear sidewalks until there was no more sidewalk.  When the sidewalk ends and you look to the left, you can see a small hill.  The forest lets you see just enough to marvel at it, but keeps some of its treasures hidden to draw you in closer.  We&#39;d been to this spot before when you could see the dirt on the ground, so we wanted to to see what it looked like in its winter attire.  The icy trails forced us to leave our bikes behind, but the small trek through the woods was worth it.  An undiscovered path is on the agenda for next Sunday.  </p>

<p>Instead of talking about how done I am with this weather and how the weather in Helsinki was equally as miserable (if not worse) and how all the pictures of warm places with people in anything less than a winter coat and boots are making me crazy... I&#39;m going to tell you about all the food we ate on our trip.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much what we did.  We ate.  So let&#39;s first talk about the Mexican-style brunch.  Anything with a slight resemblance to Mexican food and we&#39;re there.  I will admit now that it was worth the cold, wet walk over.  I&#39;m not even sure what some of the items were exactly, but I will tell you they were delicious and spicy, just how I like it.  Then there was Fafa&#39;s.  Giant falafals in fluffy pita bread.  I got the one with pesto and goat cheese.  Yes, <em>to die for</em>.  The restaurant was out of this old, white van look-alike.  Think stationary food truck.  There were only about 15 seats total, which makes you feel like you snagged a highly coveted spot.  It&#39;s located in the middle of a bunch of office buildings, so you would never find it just walking around, but we were on a mission.  Then there&#39;s my favorite, well favorites, which were all the cute cafés around town.  The one that really took the cake (I&#39;ll tell you more about that in a moment) was this small little café tucked in a corner, down the street from where we were staying.  Give me a cinnamon roll or croissant with a cappuccino for breakfast and I am a happy camper.  It&#39;s one of those places that would be very dangerous to live by because it would be calling  my name every time I passed by.  In fact it did one of the days we were there.  We were going to walk by on the way back to our apartment so I took that as an opportunity to try a slice of cake.  I&#39;m not a huge cake person, well really just not a huge frosting person, but these cakes were of the homemade variety.  They were different every day.  <em>Who eats cake in the middle of the day with no special occasion</em>, you ask?  I asked myself the same question, after my teeth were already covered in chocolatey goodness, and I decided the answer was that people who live by this place do.  So as I was temporarily living there for a couple of days, I should do as the locals do.  </p>

<p>Clearly we needed some comforting from the weather.  And we found it in the food.  It really is amazing how much the weather dictates what you eat.  So to survive this next month of on and off rain/snow/sleet, we&#39;re going to be making some really comforting food around here.  Starting with our favorite Moroccan-style stew.  Mmmmm...I can already taste those melt-in-your-mouth sweet potatoes infused with the sweet sweet spices.              </p>

<p>Some have Spring break, we have Ski break.  Both occur in March and are all about taking a little time from school to enjoy the outdoors.  Other than that, they have nothing in common.  Spring break is swimming pools, swim suits and sun.  Ski break is snow ball fights, snow shoeing and of course, skiing.  (Ok, I just noticed that they all start with S&#39;s too...so there&#39;s that).  I&#39;m all about these sorts of icy outings and I feel like I&#39;ve been a pretty darn good sport about the winter, but I&#39;m going to go ahead and call it.  I can not fool my Texas brain into thinking we&#39;re still in December.  It knows better.  It knows that this is the time to start breaking out the shorts and eating outside.  This snow just isn&#39;t going to do it for me anymore.  I&#39;m on board for it coming back in about 8 months.  But now, it&#39;s time to stop this madness.  It&#39;s been real.  Needless to say, we are not headed for the slopes next week.  We&#39;re boarding the train headed south.  Literally.  We&#39;re going to Helsinki.  Unfortunately it&#39;s not exactly beachy there either, but we&#39;ll take what we can get right now.  If you could direct any heat waves that you find in this general direction, we would greatly appreciate it.          </p>
