<p>I’ve been going about daily life here in Chile, posting ever so often over here without giving you a proper introduction to our new town and life.  So let me back up a bit.</p>

<p>We arrived in Chile a little over a month ago and have been settled into out new town of Villarrica for about four weeks.  Villerica is a small-ish town in the center of southern Chile.  As I mentioned in my last post, Villarrica sits on a beautiful lake flanked by mountains and volcanos.  ON the other side of the lake is Pucón, Villarrica’s more tourist-friendly neighbor.  The area is known for its access to nature and outdoor adventures, which we are steadily working on checking off our list.</p>

<p>Our home in Villarrica is a quaint wooden cabin, just two blocks form the lake (and less than two blacks from my school).  We are learning so many new things in our adventures in cabin life, such as how to keep a fire going all day (and all night), what to do when you run out of propane in the middle of cooking dinner on your gas stove, and sadly how to survive in the land of Nespresso.  Reminds me of our early days in Finland.  One of the best things about our cabin is that we have a view of the Villarrica Volcano from our porch.  Every day on my way to work I get to glance over at the every-changing peak - sometimes clear and calm, while at other times surrounded by smoke or moody clouds.  Another thing that I love about where we are living is that we can walk to everything - the supermarket, the laundry, our favorite pizza places, the lake, and my school.  It’s just one of those small joys that makes the everyday a little bit more enjoyable.  </p>

<p>Though in some ways I feel like we just got here, it’s hard to believe that we’re already a month in.  Times seems to be racing past us - I just wish I could hit the slow-mo button for just a little bit.     </p>
