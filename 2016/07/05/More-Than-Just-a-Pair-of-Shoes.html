<p>The other day I was walking home from the supermarket and I glanced down at my very worn in boots that had become soaked by the rain, and all of the sudden a thousand memories flooded my mind.  Memories of the places that they&#39;ve taken me, both the incredible and the tough times that they&#39;ve seen, and all the stories that they could tell came rushing towards me faster than I could process. Traveling has forced me to make purposeful decisions about my clothes, taking into account their flexibilty amongst different seasons, practicality, comfort, and style.  When I got home and put my boots away in the closet I took a quick scan of my clothes to see if anything else stood out to me as particularly meaningful.  When I did, I noticed that there were several key pieces in my wardrobe that I continue to reach for again and again no matter where we are.         </p>

<p><br>
<div class="image">
    <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Clothes" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-2.jpg" />
    <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Clothes" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-1.jpg" />
</div>
<br></p>

<p>As you can see by the pictures, these pieces have been very loved over time.  They&#39;re faded, they have stains, tears, and small rips, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from wearing them regularly.  In the past, as soon as my clothes got a stain or small tear I would toss them to the side and find something else to replace them, but now I see what a waste that was.  It&#39;s the ones with imperfections that are the guardians of the stories and cherished memories.  </p>

<p>When I look at my water-stained boots with worn toes, I am reminded of those first few months after we arrived in Finland and I quickly realized that my Texas wardrobe was not going to cut it in the fridgid north.  So I sought out to find something that would keep my feet warm and be comfortable enough to wear on a regular basis (before I was forced to wear snow boots full-time) and I finally found some that fit the bill. I stressed over that first scratch, trying to diguise it and erase it from sight.  Now, after countless scratches and stains, each new one only adds character and a new chapter to their story.  Those boots felt the first snow of our first winter in Joensuu, they collected crumbs while I indulged in countless mouth-watering pastries in Paris, they protected me from the fierce winds on the Irish coast, and now they carry me the two blocks to school everyday in Chile.           </p>

</div>
<br></p>

<p>But this post is not really about my shoes, or any of my clothes for that matter, it&#39;s about the stories that they hold deep in their fabrics.  I&#39;ve always been one that loves to drag out the old family albums to reminisce and relive old memories.  I think that&#39;s why photography speaks to me so much, it allows me to capture those moments in time, happy or sad, and feel them no matter how much time has past.  It&#39;s the stories that I really cherish, and my boots are just a reminder to keep pursuring memories.  Sometimes I lose sight, but I know that in the end it&#39;s the stories that will last, not the stuff.  So this is just a reminder to myself, <em>keep pursuring memories, you won&#39;t regret it.</em></p>

<p><br>
<strong><em>What brings back those cherished memories for you?</em></strong></p>
