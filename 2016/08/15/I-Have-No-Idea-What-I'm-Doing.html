<p>During life&#39;s ebbs and flows I go through stages where I feel like I have no idea what I&#39;m doing.  I begin to question all my past decisions and stress about all the future ones.  I start to panic about the imminent occasion where I will have to, once again, make a (relatively) important decision about what my life will look like.  I feel lost.  As if everything is closing in on me and I can&#39;t see out.  I attempt to claw my way out by laying out some options and forcing myself to make a hasty decision on the matter.  Occasionally it works temporarily and I begin to feel the sufficating sensation slip away, but it usually comes back, even stronger than before.  </p>

<p>I’m tired of insisting that I have to have a plan, and I’m tired of feeling I have to be confident that whatever it is that I’m doing or going to do is going to end up a certain way.  I’m not.  I actually have no idea what I’m doing on a daily basis, much less what I’m going to do in the future.  <em>Not. A. Clue.</em>  I’m just trying out some things as I go.  <em>Aren&#39;t we all?</em>  Sometimes they work out like I plan, but a lot of times they end up completely different than I could have ever imagined.  And then there’s the times they’re just an altogether failure.  The kind that leave you wondering if you’ll ever do anything meaningful with your life.  </p>

<p>I like to know what the end will be before I actually get there.  I want to be certain that risking embarrassment, vulnerability, and hard work is going to be worth it in the end.  Sometimes at particularly suspenseful moments while I’m reading, I can’t prevent my eyes from drifting to the bottom of the page to find out how it’s all going to work out, before I get too invested.  I have big, crazy dreams, and occasionally some pretty outlandish thoughts, but I’m scared to start them because the truth is, I don’t know how it’s all going to go.  There’s so much I don’t know.  <em>Where do I start?  Is this the right way?  Am I doing it all wrong?</em> </p>

<p>I have no idea if the choices that I’ve made and continue to make are the right ones.  I don’t know if it’s all going to come back around to bite me someday.  I have no idea what my life’s going to look like - not next year, next month, or even tomorrow.  </p>

<p>Sometimes it weighs on me, the fact that I don’t have a plan.  I don’t have it all together like I (foolishly) thought I would when I was younger.  It’s all just a big chaotic mess, really.  Straying this way and that way.  Making the best possible decisions that I can make in the moment.  Taking it one day at a time, sometimes one hour at a time, and that’s ok (at least that’s what I tell myself on the good days).  I&#39;m doing okay.  There&#39;s still so much to learn and so much to do.  It&#39;s in the times when I finally take a breath and let my plans drift away with the wind, that I feel so much better.  It&#39;s a daily struggle to loosen the tight grip I have on those plans.  Then to ultimately allow them to slip from my grasp, that&#39;s where the true feat lies.  We don’t have to have it altogether, and I am tired of convincing myself that I&#39;m supposed to act like I do.  So there it is.  Even in the times it seems like everything’s all perfectly lined up and going wonderfully, I really have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m just going to keep doing it.        </p>
