<p>I was wandering around in search of something and nothing at all,<br> 
finding the most unexpected treasures along the way.<br></p>

<p>The roads were windy, with sharp turns and the occasional dead end,<br>
I once stumbled upon a tiny footpath, barely visible from the outside.<br>
The footprints had long been covered with dirt and leaves,<br>
but I knew that someone had been there before.<br>
I imagined what they felt as they turned into the thick forest,<br>
clearing the brush as they slowly inched forward,<br> 
making a path where there had been none before.<br> 
<em>Why here?<br> 
What made them leave the road that had been so carefully laid out before them?<br>
Were they in search of something or did they knowingly brave the unknown?</em><br></p>

<p>As thousands of questions swirled around in my mind,<br>
I turned to the right, starring into the deep woods off the long forgotten path.<br>
I wanted to feel what they must have felt as they wandered into uncharted territory,<br>
As I took my first step, my foot sank unto the soft soil, the unruly branches brushed my bare legs and I inhaled the intoxicating scent of life all around me.<br>
Without any warning my legs propelled me forward,<br> 
deeper and deeper into the forest until I could no longer hear anything but birds quiet songs and leaves rustling in the wind.<br>
I kept going, following my instincts, letting my curiosity lead the way.<br></p>

<p>Before long I noticed that it was getting dark.<br> 
I came to a sudden stop and instantly felt lost.<br>
In the same place where I had found passion, I now felt intense fear.<br>
Something began to scream at me, urging me to go home,<br>
to go back to the well lit path where it was safe and I knew the way.<br>
The voice got louder and louder - I couldnâ€™t think.<br>
Panic set in.<br> 
I started to run, wildly, frantically, as the darkness swallowed everything around me.<br></p>

<p>In that same moment I caught a glimpse of the tiniest flash of light.<br>
My legs stopped running.<br>
I took a deep breath, exhaling slowly.<br>
A blanket of calm wrapped itself around my shoulders and brought warmth deep into my bones.<br>
I looked around, once again admiring the untouched nature flourishing around me.<br>
Curiosity began to creep back in until it found its way into every empty space inside me.<br>
I heard another voice, this time much quieter, almost in a whisper,<br>
reminding me that I was not lost, that nothing had changed.<br></p>

<p>I realized that this was the same place that I had been all along,<br> 
only now it was covered in the disguise of darkness.<br> 
But darkness is nothing to fear,<br>
it invites you in just the same, to take risks and discover<br>
all it asks for is a mind that is open to the unknown and a gentle heart.<br></p>

<p>Night will come, making it harder to find the way,<br>
but you are not left in complete darkness,<br>
afterall that&#39;s what the moon and the stars are for.<br>   </p>
