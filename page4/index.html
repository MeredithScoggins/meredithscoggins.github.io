In St. Petersburg it seems like around every corner there is something new to see or do.  Although we were there for three weeks, I feel like we barely scratched the surface of what the city has to offer and I’d love to go back someday.  </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.17+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia/Winter+Palace.jpg" />	<img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.21+Russia+Travel+Tips/fall+bridge.jpg" width="970" /></div>

It is named after one of Russia’s most famous poets, Alexander Pushkin, who spent many years studying there.  The town itself is full of history, palaces and parks.  We took a day trip from St. Petersburg on the oldest railway in Russia and spent our time wandering around, admiring the colors and grand buildings, on the most perfect fall day. </p> <div class="image"> <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.18+Pushkin%2C+Russia/Pushkin+bridge.jpg" width="970" /> <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.18+Pushkin%2C+Russia/Autumn+leaves.jpg" width="970" /> <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.18+Pushkin%2C+Russia/autumn+bench.jpg" width="970" /></div>

Our partner university is in Russia, so the program was designed so that our second practice would take place there.  I found out about this trip at our first program meeting when we got to Finland.  It had been a crazy, whirlwind of a week trying to get settled in a new country so I was a little taken aback when I heard about it (and not in a good way).  I wasn’t even used to this whole idea that I was going to be living in Finland for the next two years and <em>you’re sending me to Russia??</em>  Needless to say, it was just my overwhelmed, irrational self that freaked out a bit in that moment and I soon built up lots of excitement about the trip. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.17+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia/canal+to+church.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.17+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia/mosaic_palace.jpg" width="970" />	<img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.17+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia/horse+and+carriage.jpg" width="970" /></div>

With the last several months of travel, family and friends, updating the blog got pushed to the back burner.  But with our return to Finland, we’re starting to get back into the swing of things.  </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/11.04.2014+Geneva/boat+on+the+lake.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/11.04.2014+Geneva/top+of+a+castle.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/11.04.2014+Geneva/door_flower+boxes.jpg" width="970" /></div>

        <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/Ireland+Travel+Tips/Mountains_Lighthouse.jpg" width="970" /> <p> <strong>EAT</strong> <br>Everything we ate in Ireland was pretty heavenly.  We spent most of our time in small towns so there were only a limited number of restaurants to pick from, but I don’t think you can go wrong.  Seafood on the west coast is abundant. <br><br><u>The Long Dock</u> (in Loophead)&#58; This the restaurant that we were looking for when we ran into the cute little Irish children riding their bikes.  They serve tons of locally caught seafood.  The seafood chowder is uh-mazing (Scott ate seafood chowder at every restaurant we went to and he vouches for this).  Make sure to check out their craft beer list!  <br><br><u>Ashe’s Bar & Restaurant</u> (in Dingle)&#58; Another great seafood restaurant in the heart of Dingle (embrace the seafood).  The first time we tried to go for lunch and it was packed, which is always a good sign.  We made sure to come back extra early the next day to get a table.  If you order the lobster they take you over to their tank and let you pick out which lobster will end up on your plate!  <br><br><u>Idas Restaurant</u> (in Dingle)&#58; This would be a great choice if you were in the mood for a slighter fancier (and more expensive) restaurant.  If you get there before 6&#58;00 you can order from their early bird menu, so I would recommend making plans for an early meal if you’re going for dinner (this was not a problem for my dad).</p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/Ireland+Travel+Tips/Dingle_sheep+grazing.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/Ireland+Travel+Tips/Dingle_boat+and+houses.jpg" width="970" /></div>
