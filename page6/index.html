<p>Here it is.  My first day of masters school.  Since my mom is not in Finland, Scott has taken over her duties of picture taking (he is not nearly as good, mom).  But the picture lived up to its expectations just like all the other terribly awkward and unattractive first day photos…I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I rode The Viking (that’s what we’ve named her) to school, looking very collegiate with my fiancé’s backpack on.  So far I’ve learned that class scheduling in Finland is very different than what I’m used to in the states.  Most of the classes last for only 2-3 months.  So not all of them start on the first day, I have some that start in October or November.  And there’s generally no pattern to how the lessons are scheduled.  There’s no Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday classes.  There are just random days and times.  It’s been kind of confusing and somewhat difficult to organize in the beginning, but I’m thinking (hoping) that this is the hard part.  After scheduling everything I think it’ll be nice to have my classes so spread out.</p>

<p>I only had one class on my first day and everything went smoothly.  To start, we all introduced ourselves and said where we are from.  There are students from all over the world in my class – Namibia, Canada, Iran, China, Germany, Peru…the list goes on.  I’m so excited to get to know these people better and learn from their experiences in all their different countries.  I know that it will make for an interesting and rewarding two years.  Cheers to first days!</p>

        <p>We have gone four very looooooonng nights without any furniture.  Yes, that means we’ve been sleeping on the floor.  I started thinking about when I was younger and my parents would get up from the floor moaning and groaning about their legs/back/everything hurting and how I always thought that was so ridiculous.  I mean how is it even possible for your body to hurt from just sitting on the floor?? Let me tell you, it is possible.  My body now knows those pains all too well.  There is no comfortable position that you can get in when you are sleeping on the floor.  It was almost a relief when you woke up and realized that the night was over.  Finally, you can get up from the floor! And then the fireworks.  At least it sounded like that.  Popping happening all over the place.  So you can imagine the excitement on Furniture Day.  (That’s what we like to call it).  We woke up, wished each other a “Happy Furniture Day” and then the longest day of our lives commenced.  This is what it looked like.</p>

<img alt="Looking out the window" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.07.2013/IMG_3961.JPG" width="970" />
</div>

<p>ALL DAY.  Since every car in Finland has an engine that sounds exactly like a truck, we got up to look out the window approximately 152 times, only to be disappointed.  It was like waiting for Santa.  He never brings the presents while you’re awake, but you just can’t go to sleep.  So when we heard our door bell ring, it was like Christmas Day.  Except the two men at the door were holding a slip of paper instead of a bag full of presents.  Our first question – “do you speak English?”.  We got a very quick and direct “No.”.  Uh oh.  For the next couple seconds the four of us just looked at each other laughing (the kind of laughter when you have NO idea what to do next).  Then there were hand signals.  Box motions, fingers pointing down and….”Are – the – boxes – downstairs??”  Stares.  And more laughter.  Scott’s turn.  More charades.  Even more laughter.  I think we were laughing about the fact that there were two men at our door with something to tell us but no way to do it, but I’m not really even sure.  Then my genius, computer nerd fiancée pulled out google translate.  We typed in our question, handed them the computer and they typed back their response.  Thank you, technology.  Turns out they were just coming to tell us that the furniture would be delivered in 45 minutes.  We still don’t really know why they needed to tell us that.  But the important thing is 45 minutes later those same two men showed up with our 12 boxes of Ikea furniture.</p>

        <p>Over the past week or so that we’ve been living here, we’ve noticed several things that make it very clear we are not living in Texas anymore.</p>

<p>1.  No stop signs</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="Crosswalk" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/IMG_3911.jpg" width="970" />
</div>

<p>From the very first day, as we were walking around the town, we noticed that there were not any hexagonal red signs with the word “Stop” in Finnish.  There actually weren’t any signs that looked like they could be stop signs.  Every time we came to an intersection the cars would just kind of slow down and one would go, then the other.  So I asked a native Finn.  She said that there was a sort of implied yield at every intersection that did not have a stop light. You were supposed to slow down and look to see if anyone else was coming, if not you could just go ahead.  I have yet to see an accident.</p>

<p>2.  Bikes EVERYWHERE</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="Bikes" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/IMG_3919.JPG" width="970" />
</div>

<p>It is really something out of this world.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many bikes in one place.  I’m pretty sure there are more of them than cars.  On our long walks into town, there are bikes speeding past us the entire time.  And everyone rides them.  Young, old, and in between.  EXCITING NEWS: We got a bike!! Well I got a bike.  There was only one available and it was on the smaller side, so it fit me better.  It looks pretty rough, but it rides great.  You would not believe how much faster we can get places now!  Since we only have one now Scott rode it home and I sat on the back.  It was a sight to see I’m sure.  If only there were pictures…</p>

<p>3.  Blondes</p>

<p><strong>blondes not pictured due to my lack of paparazzi skills</strong></p>

<p>When we were waiting in the airport terminal for our flight on FinnAir, they were everywhere.  I have never seen so many natural blondes in one place before.  It was crazy.  Since we’ve been in Joensuu though we’ve realized that we may have gotten a skewed picture of Finland in the airport.  There are definitely a lot more natural blondes than in Texas, but it’s not the entire population.  I can stop putting lemon juice in my hair now.  Joking.</p>

<p>4.  No friendly smiles</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="Smiles" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/_DSC0718.JPG" width="970" />
</div>

<p>It is a completely natural reaction for me to smile at people when they walk past me or when I make eye contact with them.  I may even go so far as to say hello, even though I have never seen them before in my life.  Not here.  I haven’t been able to bring myself to stop trying yet, but I am not getting the reactions that I want.  Everyone is extremely nice and helpful, they are just reserved and do not go out of their way to say hello or give you a friendly smile.  But I almost feel rude if I just continue looking straight ahead and don’t even acknowledge their presence.  I will persevere.</p>

<p>5.  Shower/bathroom area</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="Shower area" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/IMG_3906.JPG" width="970" />
</div>

<p>We got the first taste of this in our hotel room when we arrived in Helsinki.  I hoped and prayed and crossed my fingers that the bathroom in our apartment would be different.  But when we got to our next hotel in Joensuu and the bathroom was the same, I lost hope.  So let me explain, there is nothing separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom.  Meaning, when you take a shower the water is not confined to the shower area, it has the freedom to go all over the bathroom if it so pleases.  I (and I really mean Scott would be doing it) had plans of building some sort of barricade on the floor to let the water know where it’s supposed to stay, but luckily the one in our bathroom really hasn’t bothered me so much.  The water seems to be tamer or the layout of our bathroom is better, but it’s working for us so far.</p>

<p>Although we realize there’s no place like Texas, we’re learning to love our new home here.</p>

        <p>Here’s a quick look at some of the things that we see on our way to school (or in Scott’s case, the coffee house).</p>

<p>I’ve never been so happy to have such a tiny dorm room with no dishwasher, no living room, and no furniture.   The day started out pretty solid when we took a walk to the river and spent some time contemplating what life would be like in the snow.  But when we went to the leasing office and they told us that the keys were ready to our flat, well that just put it over the top.  Although in our last few days in this hotel, I’ve become quite fond of it, I am ready to get to a space where we can actually walk around.  A place where our six bags do not take up the entirety of the room.  So that afternoon my Finnish friend, who has been a life saver, loaded up our bags in her car to take to the apartment.  After two trips from the hotel and six trips up the stairs to the fourth floor, we were sweating and out of breath, but we were home.  We surveyed the place and decided that it definitely felt bigger than 540 sq ft.  Hurray!!  It is definitely a worn dorm room, but other than that, it’s pretty nice.  We walked to the super market down the street from our place to gets some essentials and cleaning supplies to make it feel just a little bit more like home.</p>

<p>The super market.  Well that’s another story.  It seems like every time we have interaction with another human being these days we’re doing something ridiculous and embarrassing.  First of all, the walk to the super market is awesome.  It’s basically a walk through the forest with super tall trees surrounding you.  (Talk to me again when I have to make this walk in the snow).  So the actual shopping experience was pretty normal.  We gathered everything we needed, making an educated guess on some things since the labels were in Finnish, and went to check out.  It started off just like you would think any checking out experience would (minus the fact that she greeted me with “Hyva”, but I mummbled something back so it was all good).  As she is scanning all of our items she puts them on the conveyer belt and they slide down to the end…where no one is bagging them.  First I’m thinking “ok, that’s fine, I’m sure we just grab some bags over here and do it ourselves”.  So I look around for said bags and there are none.  I ask Scott where the bags are and he has no idea.  I’m looking around at the other people checking out to see what they are doing, but I can’t get a good look.  Plus, by this point all of our items are at the end of the conveyer belt, unbagged and there is a line forming behind us.  Scott wants us to just grab everything in our hands and carry all 30 items the 5 minute walk home.  That really didn’t sound fun to me so I decide to ask the cashier.  I started off by asking her IN FINNISH if she speaks English.  Success!  She does.  Then I was like, “Um…so….bagsss??”.  She laughed and pointed to the front of the check out line where they kept all the bags.  As we are rapidly bagging everything, so the next person in line could start, we felt relief that the next time we go to the super market we’re going to look like locals.</p>

<p>The next day:  Back at the super market, looking like pros…however, turns out that we stole (accidentally) like 7 bags.  Apparently you are supposed to pay for those.  Next time we’ll get it right, I know it.</p>
