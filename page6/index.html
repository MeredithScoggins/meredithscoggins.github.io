The first 2 hours on the bus were pretty silent.  Occasionally you could hear a short mumbled conversation, but for the most far it was silent, with heads bobbing up and down, trying desperately to get more sleep.  As we arrived in Gdańsk, heads began to perk up and eyes were peeled open to take in the new city.  Our first stop was a boat ride and tour of some of the historical WWII sites.  Seeing the city by boat was a fun new perspective as we watched people enjoying the warm sun and the colorful waterfront buildings pass by.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/07.09.2014/boat_building_river.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/07.09.2014/buildings_river.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/07.09.2014/monument.jpg" width="970" /></div>

The past month has been full of fun times and great memories, but I sure was ready to be back in my own bed.  The first two weeks of the trip I was in Toruń, Poland working with students from three other countries on an intensive summer course.  The topic was building intercultural awareness in teaching English as a foreign language.  We arrived late Sunday night after a 4.5 hour train to Helsinki, 2 hour flight to Warsaw and then a 4 hour bus ride to Toruń.  Then early Monday morning we were up for the beginning of ten long days in class (don't worry, we managed to squeeze in some time for fun).  There were nine other students from UEF that went on the trip, so I got to make some pretty great friends as well.  </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/07.02.2014/rainy_street.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/07.02.2014/flowershop_rain.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/07.02.2014/castles.jpg" width="970" /></div>

Clear skies and rising temperatures made for a pretty perfect market day.  The first traditional fish market in Joensuu was held on Saturday where vendors sold fresh fish, homemade jams, wooden handicrafts and lots of other goodies. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.18.2014/flags.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.18.2014/fish.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.18.2014/leaves.jpg" width="970" /></div>

We've had quite the busy week over here celebrating.  Vappu is the second biggest holiday celebration in Finland (first being Midsummers).  I've never seen so many people out in Joensuu – I didn't even know that many people lived here.  Although May Day is officially May 1st, the festivities ran throughout the entire week.  We started the week with the <em>flying flags</em> event at the university, where we each wrote about our experiences in Finland on the back of our country's flag.  Then we let them go together to demonstrate what the exchange students bring to Finland.  The next day we went on a bus tour of Eastern Finland.  We stopped at various places to explore and socialize, then we were back on the bus to the next stop.  On Vappu Eve there was a parade of students from the university to an island across town.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.03.2014/People_balloons.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.03.2014/Lake.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.03.2014/church_pier.jpg" width="970" /></div>

From the day we got back it's been nothing but beautiful weather.  I'm talking sunny days and warm (relatively) temperatures.  I haven't worn a scarf since we've been back.  Yesterday my legs were exposed to the Finnish sun for the first time since September.  Okay, really it was just my ankles, but it was BIG. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/04.27.2014/scott_laying_on_beach.jpg" width="970" /></div>
