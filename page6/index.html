<p>(And some pictures along the way.)  Lately we&#39;ve been transporting some abnormal things on our bikes.  Well mostly my bike because of it&#39;s awesome abilities with the basket and all.  Riding with a rug in your basket or stools on the back are a little tricky in themselves, but what makes it even more challenging is manuvering through the snow with these things.  The day that beat them all (<em>by far</em>) was the day we went to get the stools.  We decided that we needed a little more seating in our apartment and since we had people coming over the next day it seemed like the perfect time to buy some.  That day there just so happened to be a blizzard going on outside.  It seemed like as good of a day as any and the snow wasn&#39;t going to be letting up any time soon, so we just bundled up and headed out.  At first the snow is kind of enchanting, but not too far in you start to feel like tiny frozen needles are piercing your eyeballs and there couldn&#39;t be anything worse.  Except for the fact that it makes seeing almost impossible.  So we proceed to ride, eyes mostly shut, to the store.  At one point I told Scott that my eyelids would probably be frozen shut by the time we got there.  His response - just keep blinking.  After continuous blinking and an immense amount of pedaling, we arrived, both completely covered in snow but our eyes were still in tact.  An obvious progression of thought would be that our current situation makes for a perfect photo op, huh?  That&#39;s what I thought.  And Scott, after the eye rolls and sighs, reluctantly obligied.  After the picture taking, walking back to my bike, I fell (<em>karma</em>).  My first snow fall.  My feet completely came out from under me and my entire body hit the ground.  Bruised knee and all, that may have been the best part of the excursion (<em>after all, there is nothing funnier</em>).  And although the journey was completely grueling and there was a moment where I prayed a helicopter would magically appear and pick us up, when we got home with those two stools it felt like we had just climbed Mt. Everest.  We made it!  Another check off the ole bucket list.  </p>

<p>I know we&#39;re a little late, but since we don&#39;t get Thanksgiving Day off over here we decided to postpone our Thanksgiving celebration until Sunday.  It was our first year not being with family, which of course was difficult, but we wanted to make it something fun and special anyway so we had our first Friendsgiving!  We invited over some of our good friends that we&#39;ve made here in Finland, and since none of them are from the U.S. (therefore never having celebrated Thanksgiving) we had to do it right.  We spent the entire day Saturday and half of the day Sunday cooking as many traditional Thanksgiving dishes that we could manage.  Green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie...the works.  The only thing missing was the turkey.  I know, it&#39;s a pretty key piece, but the only turkey we found in Joensuu was about a million dollars, so we opted out.  And even without the turkey and our families, it turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving.  Everyone left happy and full, which to me meant that it was a success!  This year we are so thankful for our friends and family back home and for the many new friends and memories that we&#39;ve been able to make here.         </p>

<p>And it was the best weekend ever.  So good that I was a little homesick for a couple of days after we got back to Finland.  Being around such wonderful friends and family for a week will do that to ya.  Especially when you come back to dead land and freezing cold weather.  (That day of 80+ in Dallas was such a tease.)  But we&#39;re beginning to get back to life as usual again...this time as newlyweds (so weird).</p>

<p>I now understand why they say that this time of the year is the hardest for the Finns.  It&#39;s miserably cold everyday, only a couple bleak hours of sunlight and very little snow on the ground.  So you can&#39;t really do much.  No summer activities because it&#39;s too cold and no winter activities because there&#39;s not enough snow.  Snow makes all the difference.  I&#39;m amazed at how significantly brighter it is with all the white to reflect the light.  Plus, it just makes you want to get out and build a snowman.  So we&#39;re hoping for a lot of snow in the next couple weeks.</p>

<p>Last night was our first time with friends since we&#39;ve been back.  These friends live on the other side of Joensuu.  It took about 45 minutes, riding our bikes in the dark, to get there.  We don&#39;t do that for just anyone.  But I&#39;ve figured out a pretty baller way stay warm (relatively) while riding around.  You put on all the usual - jacket, gloves, boots, beenie, but the scarf is the key ingredient.  The scarf needs to be spread out, width-wise, completey and then wrapped around for the first time to cover your mouth and nose.  If the only thing visable is your eyes and you can feel your breath on your face, it&#39;s on right.  Then wrap for the second time normally and tie the two ends tight enough so that no wind, snow or incredibly weak person could pry it off of you.  And then you&#39;re ready.  You may feel like you you&#39;re stuggling to breath or eating scarf fuzz, and you are, but that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to feel like.  I promise you although your scarf (and mouth area) may be wet from condensation afterwards, your face will thank you.  </p>

<p>Our friends, that we trekked across the world for, hosted a &quot;Hamburg Night&quot; to teach us all about their hometown in Germany.  Since Hamburg is a port city they made all the traditional sailor food for us to try.  Then we watched some videos about their beautiful city.  Definitely on my long list of places I want to visit now.  After spending a week at home it was nice to realize that we do have good friends here too.  </p>

<p>Since we “fell back” last weekend, it has become even more evident that we are losing sunlight quickly.  I’ve never been a fan of the darkness.  I was one of those kids that had to sleep with a nightlight (probably for too long).  I don’t like scary movies, in part because things are always popping out at you in dark places.  I don’t like to pump gas or take the trash out when it’s dark, simply because I have a bad feeling about the darkness.  There have been several mornings where the needle was just below E and I chose to risk it rather than stop and fill up in the dark. This is all a little disheartening, considering the fact that by the end of this year we will have less than five hours of sunlight (and by sunlight I mean, it’s overcast).  The single digit weather is not the part that scares me, it’s the sun, or lack thereof.  So we’ve been making a conscious effort to appreciate every drop of sunshine that we get.  But since I have no other choice than to face the reality of short, short days, I’ve started trying to learn to like the darkness too.  One of my favorite parts so far is the soft pink hue that kisses the sky right before the black curtain falls.  It never gets old.  Even if that means sunset at 4:00.We’re also trying out some new indoor hobbies.  I’m hesitant to say this, but I’m attempting to knit.  I question if I should tell anyone because, why is it so difficult??  I’ve started over three times already.  Maybe by summertime I’ll finish this scarf.  Some way or another we will survive this long winter.  One of those ways being planning a return of the sun party.          </p>

<p align="center"><em>* die hard fans *</em></p>

<p>Sauna, coffee, and ice hockey – that pretty much sums up priorities in Finland.  So on Saturday we went out to support Joensuu’s ice hockey team, the mighty Jokipojat.  There was a band and rowdy fans, which is exactly what I had hoped for.  We obviously brought with us some good mojo because they dominated.  I learned more about ice hockey than I ever knew existed.  Soon enough I’ll be the one standing by the band, yelling at the teams about what they’re doing wrong.</p>

<p>On another note, it’s cold here.  All the snow that I boasted about before is sadly gone now (thanks to the massive amount of rain that we’ve had), but I did get a chance to practice for the world’s slowest bike rider competition before it left.  Let me tell you, the conditions were just right for it.  There was a bunch of slush on the ground that day.  You’d think “Slush? How hard can it be to glide through some soft snow and water??”  That’s what I thought.  But when that slush is packed on top of a layer of thick, uneven ice, well that makes it a little more challenging.  It usually takes me 20 minutes to ride my bike to school.  On this particular day it took me at least twice as long (which is good statistics for slow competitions).  I was going barely faster than you could walk.  Going that slow on a bike is really a skill.  If you slow down even the slightest, there is a very good chance you will fall over.  But when you are riding on ice, if you speed up at all and hit the tiniest of bumps, there is also a very good chance you will fall over.  So I’m working with this balancing act for over 3 miles.  At one point I considered just collapsing on the snow in hope that someone would come along and rescue me.  But after 29 near wipe outs, I had outsmarted the ice and made it to school.  My feet were soaking wet from the giant puddles that I stepped in (to avoid a fall), but all was good because I made it to shelter.  Of course on my way home some nice snow fairy had come along and plowed all the snow on the sidewalks – so it was smooth sailing.  Compared to my previous riding time, I felt like I was flying down the road.  All the snow is gone now, so bike riding is back to normal.  But when the snow does come back, and it will, I just hope that the snow fairy comes back with it (and is considerate of when I need to go to class).</p>
