I'm going to tell you about all the food we ate on our trip.</p>  <div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/03.07.2014/buildings_street.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/03.07.2014/green+building.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/03.07.2014/book_shelves.jpg" width="970" /></div>

Both occur in March and are all about taking a little time from school to enjoy the outdoors.  Other than that, they have nothing in common.  Spring break is swimming pools, swim suits and sun.  Ski break is snow ball fights, snow shoeing and of course, skiing.

I know that we've lived here for almost 6 months now, but it continues to fascinate me.  For one, Finns come alive in the winter.  It's like someone flipped a switch and everyone suddenly sprang to life.  When the days get down to 20 or below, you can see the smiles on their faces and hear the excitement in their voices.  <em>Finally</em>, they say, <em>a proper winter</em>!  They use words like <em>fresh</em> to describe freezing temperatures.  I guess when winter takes up a majority of the year, you learn to embrace it.  No, they don't embrace it, they <em>thrive</em> off it.  All year they are waiting until the conditions are right for skiing, ice hockey, skating, ice fishing and all their other favorite winter activities.  They will tell you that the best sauna is the one when you can take a break from the heat to roll around in the snow (with no clothes on).  Now, I don't want to make any over-generalizations about the entire population.  I have met a Finn that wasn't a fan of winter, but I'd say those are few and far between.  Most of the time, you will find them enjoying the outdoors during these snow-covered days.   </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/snowshoeing_trees.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/showshoeing_wheatgrass.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.21.2014/people_frozenlake.jpg" width="970" /></div>

Maybe that's why I haven't posted in a while.  Not because we've been in hibernation (as I predicted in my last post), it has been quite the opposite actually, I think it's because we're really getting settled in now.  We have routines, schedules, and everything feels so normal now.  Like this is our home.  </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.10.2014/branches.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/02.10.2014/bridge.jpg" width="970" /></div>
