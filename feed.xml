&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#39;re a little late, but since we don&amp;#39;t get Thanksgiving Day off over here we decided to postpone our Thanksgiving celebration until Sunday.  It was our first year not being with family, which of course was difficult, but we wanted to make it something fun and special anyway so we had our first Friendsgiving!  We invited over some of our good friends that we&amp;#39;ve made here in Finland, and since none of them are from the U.S. (therefore never having celebrated Thanksgiving) we had to do it right.  We spent the entire day Saturday and half of the day Sunday cooking as many traditional Thanksgiving dishes that we could manage.  Green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie...the works.  The only thing missing was the turkey.  I know, it&amp;#39;s a pretty key piece, but the only turkey we found in Joensuu was about a million dollars, so we opted out.  And even without the turkey and our families, it turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving.  Everyone left happy and full, which to me meant that it was a success!  This year we are so thankful for our friends and family back home and for the many new friends and memories that we&amp;#39;ve been able to make here.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was the best weekend ever.  So good that I was a little homesick for a couple of days after we got back to Finland.  Being around such wonderful friends and family for a week will do that to ya.  Especially when you come back to dead land and freezing cold weather.  (That day of 80+ in Dallas was such a tease.)  But we&amp;#39;re beginning to get back to life as usual again...this time as newlyweds (so weird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now understand why they say that this time of the year is the hardest for the Finns.  It&amp;#39;s miserably cold everyday, only a couple bleak hours of sunlight and very little snow on the ground.  So you can&amp;#39;t really do much.  No summer activities because it&amp;#39;s too cold and no winter activities because there&amp;#39;s not enough snow.  Snow makes all the difference.  I&amp;#39;m amazed at how significantly brighter it is with all the white to reflect the light.  Plus, it just makes you want to get out and build a snowman.  So we&amp;#39;re hoping for a lot of snow in the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was our first time with friends since we&amp;#39;ve been back.  These friends live on the other side of Joensuu.  It took about 45 minutes, riding our bikes in the dark, to get there.  We don&amp;#39;t do that for just anyone.  But I&amp;#39;ve figured out a pretty baller way stay warm (relatively) while riding around.  You put on all the usual - jacket, gloves, boots, beenie, but the scarf is the key ingredient.  The scarf needs to be spread out, width-wise, completey and then wrapped around for the first time to cover your mouth and nose.  If the only thing visable is your eyes and you can feel your breath on your face, it&amp;#39;s on right.  Then wrap for the second time normally and tie the two ends tight enough so that no wind, snow or incredibly weak person could pry it off of you.  And then you&amp;#39;re ready.  You may feel like you you&amp;#39;re stuggling to breath or eating scarf fuzz, and you are, but that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s supposed to feel like.  I promise you although your scarf (and mouth area) may be wet from condensation afterwards, your face will thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friends, that we trekked across the world for, hosted a &amp;quot;Hamburg Night&amp;quot; to teach us all about their hometown in Germany.  Since Hamburg is a port city they made all the traditional sailor food for us to try.  Then we watched some videos about their beautiful city.  Definitely on my long list of places I want to visit now.  After spending a week at home it was nice to realize that we do have good friends here too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we “fell back” last weekend, it has become even more evident that we are losing sunlight quickly.  I’ve never been a fan of the darkness.  I was one of those kids that had to sleep with a nightlight (probably for too long).  I don’t like scary movies, in part because things are always popping out at you in dark places.  I don’t like to pump gas or take the trash out when it’s dark, simply because I have a bad feeling about the darkness.  There have been several mornings where the needle was just below E and I chose to risk it rather than stop and fill up in the dark. This is all a little disheartening, considering the fact that by the end of this year we will have less than five hours of sunlight (and by sunlight I mean, it’s overcast).  The single digit weather is not the part that scares me, it’s the sun, or lack thereof.  So we’ve been making a conscious effort to appreciate every drop of sunshine that we get.  But since I have no other choice than to face the reality of short, short days, I’ve started trying to learn to like the darkness too.  One of my favorite parts so far is the soft pink hue that kisses the sky right before the black curtain falls.  It never gets old.  Even if that means sunset at 4:00.We’re also trying out some new indoor hobbies.  I’m hesitant to say this, but I’m attempting to knit.  I question if I should tell anyone because, why is it so difficult??  I’ve started over three times already.  Maybe by summertime I’ll finish this scarf.  Some way or another we will survive this long winter.  One of those ways being planning a return of the sun party.          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all photos were taken before 4:30 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;* die hard fans *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sauna, coffee, and ice hockey – that pretty much sums up priorities in Finland.  So on Saturday we went out to support Joensuu’s ice hockey team, the mighty Jokipojat.  There was a band and rowdy fans, which is exactly what I had hoped for.  We obviously brought with us some good mojo because they dominated.  I learned more about ice hockey than I ever knew existed.  Soon enough I’ll be the one standing by the band, yelling at the teams about what they’re doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, it’s cold here.  All the snow that I boasted about before is sadly gone now (thanks to the massive amount of rain that we’ve had), but I did get a chance to practice for the world’s slowest bike rider competition before it left.  Let me tell you, the conditions were just right for it.  There was a bunch of slush on the ground that day.  You’d think “Slush? How hard can it be to glide through some soft snow and water??”  That’s what I thought.  But when that slush is packed on top of a layer of thick, uneven ice, well that makes it a little more challenging.  It usually takes me 20 minutes to ride my bike to school.  On this particular day it took me at least twice as long (which is good statistics for slow competitions).  I was going barely faster than you could walk.  Going that slow on a bike is really a skill.  If you slow down even the slightest, there is a very good chance you will fall over.  But when you are riding on ice, if you speed up at all and hit the tiniest of bumps, there is also a very good chance you will fall over.  So I’m working with this balancing act for over 3 miles.  At one point I considered just collapsing on the snow in hope that someone would come along and rescue me.  But after 29 near wipe outs, I had outsmarted the ice and made it to school.  My feet were soaking wet from the giant puddles that I stepped in (to avoid a fall), but all was good because I made it to shelter.  Of course on my way home some nice snow fairy had come along and plowed all the snow on the sidewalks – so it was smooth sailing.  Compared to my previous riding time, I felt like I was flying down the road.  All the snow is gone now, so bike riding is back to normal.  But when the snow does come back, and it will, I just hope that the snow fairy comes back with it (and is considerate of when I need to go to class).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our weekend was filled with snowflakes, movies and chicken pot pie.  We had a pretty relaxing weekend over here, recovering from our travels, plus it just felt right to snuggle up under a blanket with all the snowing that is going on outside.  Thursday it was very much fall, then we woke up on Friday and it was winter.  Full force winter.  We basically just sat at the kitchen table all day marveling at the giant snowflakes and the fact that they just kept coming, trying to imagine what it’s going to be like in a couple months.  Time to dust off our cross country skis – I mean, maybe we should find some and learn how to use them.  We even got to practice a little snow bike riding (with helmets on, of course).  Just as I was fitting in with the cool kids with my no-handed riding (yep, you heard me, a whole 40 seconds)…well there will be none of that for the next four months.  Everyone keeps saying that this is only the beginning, that it’s only getting colder and so much snowier from here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, bring it on, snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tallinn, before I moved to Finland I had never heard of the likes of you and could not place your small country on a map. But I am sure glad we’ve been introduced now. What Joensuu is lacking in old world charm, you sure make up for it. With your pastel-colored medieval buildings and cozy cafés, you have won my heart. Your hidden nooks, used as viewing platforms, as the sky is painted pink in the evenings, well that’s just the cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost missing our train to Helsinki and then a quick ferry over the Baltic Sea, we’ve spent the past four days exploring the city of Tallinn. I highly recommend it. Old Town is pretty wonderful. Although it can be pretty touristy in some parts, I just couldn’t get enough of all the colorful buildings and cobblestone roads (though we’ve decided that’s why we are having feet/knee pains now). I don’t think that I’ve ever, purposefully, sat outside to eat a meal when it’s below 45 degrees, but that’s just what this town does to you. The outdoors call your name, the atmosphere is just too good to pass up. Amongst the beautiful churches and history of secret KGB headquarters, I think my favorite part of the trip was the visit to a certain giant slab of concrete. The concrete rooftop was built by the Soviets for the Olympic regatta of 1980. The rooftop in itself was not all that spectacular, but the view from the top was unbeatable. There was a little of Old Town to your left, the sea in front, and downtown Tallinn to your right. Sitting up top, watching the ferries come and go while the sun sets, is my idea of a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our trip was not without mishaps. For starters, we almost missed our train. I know I mentioned that earlier and you were picturing us running through the train station, hair blowing in the wind, jumping on the train just in time and then giggling at the close call. I wish. There we were waiting in line to print out our tickets, just 10 minutes before departure. Of course it was a long line and the machine was slow, that makes it all the more exciting. So our turn, with about 5 minutes left, and we can not figure out how to print the tickets. We ask the Finnish person behind us, no help. Our only other option is to go to the help desk, where the line is even longer. We both stand there in line, looking at the clock, then each other, panicking (well I’m panicking). Here are our options: wait in line and by the time we get to talk to someone it would be too late OR go get on the train and cross our fingers they won’t kick us off. It was a no brainer, we would take our chances with the train bouncers. I don’t think either of us took a breath as the ticket man was walking down our aisle. In my head I’m trying to formulate a backup plan if our email confirmation doesn’t work. Can I beg? Start crying? Offer him some of our trail mix we packed for a snack? Luckily I didn’t have to do any of those. The tickets worked. And for the other bloopers, well Scott almost ate it face first into the cobblestone walking down some stairs (I actually consider this a high point, since there is nothing funnier than falling…but I’m considering the general population’s views here). We also walked around in a circle at one point looking for a hotel, only to find out that we had literally been standing right in front of it to start with. These are the real life stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. We had our first Tex-Mex meal in over a month right here in Tallinn. Who knew they’d have their very own “Honky Tonk Texas Cantina”! Now I’m craving it again more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love nights around a bonfire.  They really bring people together.  There’s always lots of eating, laughing and entertaining stories to accompany them.  This weekend we definitely got our fair share of bonfire time.  Friday night we went with some of our new friends from Spain to build a bonfire and cook out near our apartment.  It was perfect.  The meeting of new people, eating of tortilla española and the gazing at stars was more than I could’ve asked for.The stars were pretty amazing.  They decorated the entire sky with twinkling light.  That’s one of the really special things about the middle of the forest at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had so much fun that we decided to do it again Saturday night!  We trekked over to the other side of town to celebrate a friend’s 30th birthday.  These little hidden treasure’s in Joensuu make you want to bonfire (yes, you can also use it as a verb) every night of the week.  We rented a little cabin by the lake where the only light inside came from the dimly lit fire and the candles sprinkled throughout.   We kept that fire going all night.  Even though that in itself would have been enough, the best part of the evening was getting to share a classic American tradition.  The s’more.  We had the great privilege of demonstrating how to roast a marshmallow (that we smuggled back from Texas) to the perfect golden brown state and transform that lonely marshmallow into a mouthwatering chocolate-graham cracker sandwich.  It was magical.  I’ll just say there were seconds involved. They’re not called s’mores for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wait is over.  Winter has arrived.  I don’t know if these people technically consider this winter, but this is definitely winter weather to me.  I had to break out the puffy coat, that’s when you know.  I think I wore it maybe three times last winter.  I always felt like “oh, it’s not that cold, I’m going to look ridiculous in this giant puffy coat.”  I think I want another one now…to wear on top of my current one.  The other day on my way home, it snowed.  Yes, snow flakes in SEPTEMBER!  It was brief, but there was no mistaking the plastering of ice to my face.  Of course at that point I’m already on my bike, gloves and hat on.  I really wanted to pull my giant fur hood on too, but for some reason my hands are incapable of doing anything productive once gloves are on.  They won’t button or zip anything, much less any more complex form of dexterity, like gripping and pulling…at the same time.  I learned this the hard way.  From now on, I will get completely put together before starting out on my trek.  Once I start there’s no stopping.  So I succumbed to the fact the hood is not going to work and continued my journey home.  I don’t know if there was anybody else on the sidewalk, I was in full survival mode.  Head down, gritting my teeth, pedaling as fast as my legs would let me.  (I was making some really serious faces…they help).  The small little inclines felt like Mt. Everest.  I didn’t know if I’d ever make it.  When I did finally get to my apartment, I had to fumble through keys, backpacks and bikes (why is everything more difficult when it’s cold?) before I got to shelter.  The weird thing is, once you’re inside and peel off the several layers of extra clothes, you think – that really wasn’t so bad.  But deep down you know that you’re just fooling yourself…it really is that bad.  Only 5 more months of this, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend Scott and I spent our days off at an organic farm outside of Joensuu.  Twice a year the owners of the farm have a volunteer weekend where people can come help harvest vegetables from their garden.  In return they provide a place to sleep and lots and lots of good, fresh food.  It was quite an experience.  Neither of us had ever done anything like it before.  We had so much fun (despite the fact that I couldn’t feel my hands half of the time), we 
will definitely be back again.  Our hosts, Niina and Pjotr, were such sweet people and taught us some quite interesting tidbits about farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had severals “firsts” over the weekend.  Our first time harvesting any kind of food, our first Finnish sauna, and Scott’s first, but surely not last, time sporting overalls.  He really rocked those overalls all weekend.  I think overalls automatically make you better at anything farming.  If nothing else, they sure make you look like you know what you’re doing.  We were such naturals at this whole harvesting thing that we plowed right on through the carrots and on to the beet roots and parsnips (with the help of about 25 other people).  I did have to stop for a couple dance breaks though.  That’s when you have to stand up and wiggle your fingers and toes to make sure that they’re all still there.  Being outside in 40 degree weather all day will make you question their existence.  But it was all worth it when we got to thaw out inside and inhale the delicious pumpkin-carrot soup and mounds of bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty excited to try out some new soups with our bag of veggies that made it home with us.&lt;/p&gt;

                        <title>making lists</title>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this list to fill in online, and seeing how making lists is on my top 10 favorite things to do, I thought I would give it a try.  Lists are so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;leaves&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.26.2013/_DSC1159.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making: do without a straightener.  There’s really no use with how wind blown my hair gets.
Cooking: salmon – pan seared salmon, salmon soup, salmon pie, you name it.
Drinking: café lattes every morning :)
Reading: articles about multiculturalism…really feeling like a student again.
Wanting: mexican food, BBQ, marshmallows.
Looking: for a pair of hiking pants.
Playing: like we know what we’re doing every time we go to the grocery store.  If you stare at the labels for just the right amount of time, it looks like you’re reading them.
Wasting: nothing in our refrigerator, living like true college students.
Sewing: nothing, but really wishing someone would sew me many pairs of mittens. And maybe a face mask while you’re at it.
Wishing: I could speak Finnish.
Enjoying: nature.
Waiting: for snowboarding season.
Liking: my bike with a basket on front.  That’s really all I ever wanted in life.
Wondering: when I’m going to have to break out the thermal underwear.  Very likely it could be tomorrow.
Loving: living abroad.
Hoping: to see Aurora Borealis in Joensuu.
Marveling: at people riding bikes no-handed, I seriously don’t get it.  It’s magical.
Needing: a microwave and a freezer, how do you live without??
Smelling: campfires.  Makes me jealous every time.
Wearing: hats, gloves, scarves, multiple jackets…anything to stay warm.
Following: the same path to school everyday.  It’s very likely that I’d get lost if I don’t.
Noticing: that somehow there is always one fly in our apartment, even though we killed one the day before.
Knowing: that the days are getting shorter and shorter.
Thinking: about our first trip in a couple of weeks.
Feeling: cold.  I think I spoke too soon about this amazing autumn weather.
Bookmarking: every place that I want to travel to.  Could be getting a little out of hand.
Opening: the couch…because it has storage!  Did I mention how awesome it is?
Giggling: at Scott being afraid of the giant birds.
Feeling: like November is coming really soon! :)&lt;/p&gt;
