&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to and following New Year&amp;#39;s Eve we spent some time visiting two other cities in Lapland. Tornio is a small town that shares a border with the Swedish town of Haparanda. There wasn&amp;#39;t much to do in this small town, but it was kind of fun to walk right over to Sweden. Oh and a bonus to that is we went to a Swedish IKEA (&lt;em&gt;score&lt;/em&gt;). Most of the time IKEA is a nightmare because you generally go to buy one thing and you end up spending your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; day there due to the endless maze of a store. However, when you are in Tornio and you are wandering around trying to find something to do, preferably indoors, walking slowly through an IKEA isn&amp;#39;t half bad. (Plus we just wanted to say we&amp;#39;d been to an IKEA where it all began). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were there we also saw one of the oldest wooden churches in Finland, built in 1686, and went to a fake Tex-Mex restaurant. The person writing for Lonely Planet must not be from Texas because what we experienced was quite possibly the furthest thing from Tex-Mex. The jalapeño poppers weren&amp;#39;t even spicy.  &lt;em&gt;What is that??&lt;/em&gt; We actually had our first encounter with reindeer at this said Tex-Mex restaurant. After that we ate it another three times over the course of our trip in the form of, reindeer soup, reindeer burger and sautéed reindeer. I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that we enjoyed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stay in Kemi was a little more exciting (though it doesn&amp;#39;t even come close to the huskies).  Kemi is a port town that is known for its Snow Castle and Ice Breaker ship.  Unfortunately, neither of these things were open yet. We did get to see the beginnings of the Ice Castle though, which look pretty amazing. When it&amp;#39;s finished you can book a room inside the castle where it&amp;#39;s like -18 degrees Celsius.  Apparently it&amp;#39;s also a fairly popular spot for people to get married or honeymoon in the winter (if we had only known...). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things we did while we were there was walk on the frozen sea. There was a hole in the ice about 15 feet from shore that looked man-made, so we figured it had to be safe to walk on. It was a little risky, as we could have very well fallen through the ice and frozen to death, but fortunately we lived to tell about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our New Year&amp;#39;s Eve plans, as usual, were left to the last minute.  (We like to live on the edge).  Joensuu was a ghost town for the Christmas break and all flights, to just about everywhere, were jacked up for the holidays.  We knew we had to get out and do something or the darkness would swallow us up (&lt;em&gt;and because I get really antsy&lt;/em&gt;).  So after exhausting several options, we made the decision to travel to even more darkness and snow.  The bright side of this is that Santa would be there and he can brighten even the darkest of days, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;  Joulupukki, as the Finns call him, has a village that sits on the Article Circle, just north of Rovaniemi.  He has a post office where you can write yourself letters to be sent or have Santa himself send you one.  He has a workshop, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;, where you can buy many of the trinkets that his elves make.  There&amp;#39;s a Santa restaurant, café, and everything else you could imagine.  But the real reason that we went (don&amp;#39;t tell Santa) is for the huskies.  These are not your average huskies.  These puppies are masters of the sleigh.  We opted for an hour long sleigh ride. When we got to &amp;quot;Husky Park&amp;quot; we were informed that there was a snow problem and we may not be able to go (cue extreme disappointment).  But we soon found out that one of the women working there was going to take us out, WAY out, into the woods to a family that raises and trains the dogs for our ride.  We were super pumped.  Even more so when we learned that we would be &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; our own team of dogs.  I had imagined we would both just be along for the ride.  Little did we know Scott would be the leader (well other than the lead dogs, that is).  If that was the only thing we had done the entire time we were there, it would have been worth it.  The experience was unforgettable. The dogs were amazing.  We learned how they were trained and the different jobs each of them had on the team.  I was in awe of how good they were.  Oh, and then to top it off, we got to see some tiny husky babies. &lt;em&gt;I died&lt;/em&gt;. Just about the cutest things I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.  I apologize for the exessive amount of dog photos, but it could have been way worse.  And, I mean, if you don&amp;#39;t like pictures of dogs, &lt;em&gt;what&amp;#39;s wrong with you?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it back to Kemi just before midnight and rang in the new year at the Old Gringo.  2013 was really good to us and I have a feeling 2014 is going to be a pretty great year too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After countless times passing through, we finally got to spend a little time in Helsinki.  We went straight from several days of luxury in Switzerland to two nights in the smallest apartment ever.  &lt;em&gt;And we thought our apartment was small.&lt;/em&gt; The bathroom in this place could barely fit one person at a time, literally.  You could brush your teeth, use the toilet and take a shower, all at the same time.  Luckily, we didn&amp;#39;t spend much time inside or I might have gone crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main objective for this trip was to visit as many Christmas markets as possible.  We hit up three and got a good fill of Christmas spirit.  Since Joensuu is not exactly a booming metropolis, we decided to get our Christmas shopping done in Helsinki.  All of the markets had various stands that sold homemade good and treats, but each one was a little bit different from the others.  Glögi, the Finnish version of mulled wine, is found everywhere around Christmas.  It&amp;#39;s traditionally served with almonds and raisins, in the actual drink.  I was initially hesitant about nuts in my drink, but it ends up being a nice little snack when you&amp;#39;re finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have really loved living in and visiting some of the smaller towns around Europe.  I think it has forced me to take a look around and appreciate the little things.  It&amp;#39;s nice to feel like we live in the middle of the forest.  Whenever I&amp;#39;m in the city center, I always stop and think real hard about anything else I need to do/get while I&amp;#39;m there because if I forget something, &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; it better be worth an hour long bike ride.  But I was raised in the city.  Deep down at my core, I&amp;#39;m a city girl.  So while we were in Helsinki, this surpressed city girl in me was doing cartwheels and flips.  I loved getting to try all the fun restaurants and cafés.  I loved that no matter where we were there was a store/restaurant/market/people around us.  We went to brunch for the first time since we&amp;#39;ve moved and it was deeeeelicious.  Oh how I miss overly priced food with fancy names.  My mouth is still watering just thinking about the mounds of food that we devoured.  It filled my compartment designated for big city things.  But truthfully, I missed Joensuu.  I was so happy to be back to our little apartment where the only thing we can hear is the loud sneezer that lives next door.  It&amp;#39;s nice to have some quiet time too.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our exciting encounters with the mountains via snowboards, we spent our last full day exploring them on something a little more familiar.  There was a hiking trail near our hotel that took us to see some pretty mesmerizing views.  We first walked through the cutest neighborhood that I&amp;#39;m convinced we&amp;#39;ll live in some day (just like every other place we visit).  The houses all had names written on them and they all looked like they would have the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; fire place inside.  Towards the end of our hike it started to snow.  Much to our surprise, Switzerland was warmer than what we are used to in Finland, so the snow was a welcomed treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important things that we learned: everyone in Switzerland is trilingual (at least where we were), so we&amp;#39;ve really got to step up our game.  Also, I learned that you should be really sure that an egg is boiled before you try to crack it (&lt;em&gt;important life lessons&lt;/em&gt;).  Our first morning at breakfast I made it pretty clear to everyone around me that I had yet to learn this lesson.  I was really sure that this egg was boiled, &lt;em&gt;why would you serve an un-boiled egg???&lt;/em&gt;  So I tried to crack it.  It was really hard and wouldn&amp;#39;t crack on the table.  So I squeezed with all my might.  And then it cracked.  All. Over.  All over my shirt, all over my pants, all over the floor and all over my food.  It was quite a scene.  Needless to say, I avoided the eggs for the remainder of the trip.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all Switzerland was pretty amazing.  I could have stared at those mountains all day.  We were so lucky to get to spend our honeymoom amongst them.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea of the perfect honeymoon had always been a relaxing week on the beach, laying out in the scorching sun with little umbrellas in my drinks.  But since our recent move forced us pretty far north in the world, we felt like a warm beach was just too far away for a December trip, so we decided to embrace the winter.  Our minds were made up when Scott found an advertisement for a hotel wih an infinity pool looking out over the Swiss Alps - sign me up!  It really was everything we imagined (from the picture).  Skiing/snowboarding, a wintry hike and lots and lots of pool time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our journey began when our Finnish speaking skills failed us, yet again, and we were forced to walk to the train station in the snow/ice.  An hour pulling/pushing/dragging luagge through the ice qualified as my exercise for the rest of the year.  I was not a happy camper, starting from about three minutes in.  From there it took us a train, a plane, &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; train (with one transfer), and a bus to get us to this quaint Swiss town, but it was so worth it.  (I&amp;#39;d probably still be at the train station without Scott&amp;#39;s supreme navigating skills).  The people in Adelboden were so friendly and everyone spoke English (small victories).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect maybe skiing, with it being Scott&amp;#39;s first time and on some pretty narrow/steep slopes, was not the best honeymoon activity.  (The Swiss definition of &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; was a little different than ours).  We spent our first day with me trying really hard to be a good and patient snow board instructor and Scott not really feeling like I was succeeding at that.  Then I took a pretty serious tumble which left me partially crippled the rest of the trip.  At least these will be stories to entertain our children with some day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And some pictures along the way.)  Lately we&amp;#39;ve been transporting some abnormal things on our bikes.  Well mostly my bike because of it&amp;#39;s awesome abilities with the basket and all.  Riding with a rug in your basket or stools on the back are a little tricky in themselves, but what makes it even more challenging is manuvering through the snow with these things.  The day that beat them all (&lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt;) was the day we went to get the stools.  We decided that we needed a little more seating in our apartment and since we had people coming over the next day it seemed like the perfect time to buy some.  That day there just so happened to be a blizzard going on outside.  It seemed like as good of a day as any and the snow wasn&amp;#39;t going to be letting up any time soon, so we just bundled up and headed out.  At first the snow is kind of enchanting, but not too far in you start to feel like tiny frozen needles are piercing your eyeballs and there couldn&amp;#39;t be anything worse.  Except for the fact that it makes seeing almost impossible.  So we proceed to ride, eyes mostly shut, to the store.  At one point I told Scott that my eyelids would probably be frozen shut by the time we got there.  His response - just keep blinking.  After continuous blinking and an immense amount of pedaling, we arrived, both completely covered in snow but our eyes were still in tact.  An obvious progression of thought would be that our current situation makes for a perfect photo op, huh?  That&amp;#39;s what I thought.  And Scott, after the eye rolls and sighs, reluctantly obligied.  After the picture taking, walking back to my bike, I fell (&lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt;).  My first snow fall.  My feet completely came out from under me and my entire body hit the ground.  Bruised knee and all, that may have been the best part of the excursion (&lt;em&gt;after all, there is nothing funnier&lt;/em&gt;).  And although the journey was completely grueling and there was a moment where I prayed a helicopter would magically appear and pick us up, when we got home with those two stools it felt like we had just climbed Mt. Everest.  We made it!  Another check off the ole bucket list.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#39;re a little late, but since we don&amp;#39;t get Thanksgiving Day off over here we decided to postpone our Thanksgiving celebration until Sunday.  It was our first year not being with family, which of course was difficult, but we wanted to make it something fun and special anyway so we had our first Friendsgiving!  We invited over some of our good friends that we&amp;#39;ve made here in Finland, and since none of them are from the U.S. (therefore never having celebrated Thanksgiving) we had to do it right.  We spent the entire day Saturday and half of the day Sunday cooking as many traditional Thanksgiving dishes that we could manage.  Green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie...the works.  The only thing missing was the turkey.  I know, it&amp;#39;s a pretty key piece, but the only turkey we found in Joensuu was about a million dollars, so we opted out.  And even without the turkey and our families, it turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving.  Everyone left happy and full, which to me meant that it was a success!  This year we are so thankful for our friends and family back home and for the many new friends and memories that we&amp;#39;ve been able to make here.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was the best weekend ever.  So good that I was a little homesick for a couple of days after we got back to Finland.  Being around such wonderful friends and family for a week will do that to ya.  Especially when you come back to dead land and freezing cold weather.  (That day of 80+ in Dallas was such a tease.)  But we&amp;#39;re beginning to get back to life as usual again...this time as newlyweds (so weird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now understand why they say that this time of the year is the hardest for the Finns.  It&amp;#39;s miserably cold everyday, only a couple bleak hours of sunlight and very little snow on the ground.  So you can&amp;#39;t really do much.  No summer activities because it&amp;#39;s too cold and no winter activities because there&amp;#39;s not enough snow.  Snow makes all the difference.  I&amp;#39;m amazed at how significantly brighter it is with all the white to reflect the light.  Plus, it just makes you want to get out and build a snowman.  So we&amp;#39;re hoping for a lot of snow in the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was our first time with friends since we&amp;#39;ve been back.  These friends live on the other side of Joensuu.  It took about 45 minutes, riding our bikes in the dark, to get there.  We don&amp;#39;t do that for just anyone.  But I&amp;#39;ve figured out a pretty baller way stay warm (relatively) while riding around.  You put on all the usual - jacket, gloves, boots, beenie, but the scarf is the key ingredient.  The scarf needs to be spread out, width-wise, completey and then wrapped around for the first time to cover your mouth and nose.  If the only thing visable is your eyes and you can feel your breath on your face, it&amp;#39;s on right.  Then wrap for the second time normally and tie the two ends tight enough so that no wind, snow or incredibly weak person could pry it off of you.  And then you&amp;#39;re ready.  You may feel like you you&amp;#39;re stuggling to breath or eating scarf fuzz, and you are, but that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s supposed to feel like.  I promise you although your scarf (and mouth area) may be wet from condensation afterwards, your face will thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friends, that we trekked across the world for, hosted a &amp;quot;Hamburg Night&amp;quot; to teach us all about their hometown in Germany.  Since Hamburg is a port city they made all the traditional sailor food for us to try.  Then we watched some videos about their beautiful city.  Definitely on my long list of places I want to visit now.  After spending a week at home it was nice to realize that we do have good friends here too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we “fell back” last weekend, it has become even more evident that we are losing sunlight quickly.  I’ve never been a fan of the darkness.  I was one of those kids that had to sleep with a nightlight (probably for too long).  I don’t like scary movies, in part because things are always popping out at you in dark places.  I don’t like to pump gas or take the trash out when it’s dark, simply because I have a bad feeling about the darkness.  There have been several mornings where the needle was just below E and I chose to risk it rather than stop and fill up in the dark. This is all a little disheartening, considering the fact that by the end of this year we will have less than five hours of sunlight (and by sunlight I mean, it’s overcast).  The single digit weather is not the part that scares me, it’s the sun, or lack thereof.  So we’ve been making a conscious effort to appreciate every drop of sunshine that we get.  But since I have no other choice than to face the reality of short, short days, I’ve started trying to learn to like the darkness too.  One of my favorite parts so far is the soft pink hue that kisses the sky right before the black curtain falls.  It never gets old.  Even if that means sunset at 4:00.We’re also trying out some new indoor hobbies.  I’m hesitant to say this, but I’m attempting to knit.  I question if I should tell anyone because, why is it so difficult??  I’ve started over three times already.  Maybe by summertime I’ll finish this scarf.  Some way or another we will survive this long winter.  One of those ways being planning a return of the sun party.          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all photos were taken before 4:30 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
