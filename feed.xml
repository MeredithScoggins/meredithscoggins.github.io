&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything’s funnier in a British accent, don’t you think?  I’m that person that turns around and giggles every time someone says “Cheers!”, even when it’s the 274th time I’ve heard it in a week.  But you know what &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; gets me…little British children.  I mean, can you think of anything cuter than a three year-old telling his &lt;em&gt;mummy&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks going to the zoo this afternoon is going to be &lt;em&gt;quite lovely&lt;/em&gt;?  That’s because there isn’t.  Nothing tops that.  Our days were filled with practicing of our own British accents every chance we got, which was &lt;em&gt;quite often&lt;/em&gt;.  I’m not sure if everyone else got quite the kick out of our constant impersonations as we did though.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much history in London, and all of England, you could be there for months and still not see everything.  We tried to see all the major tourist sites, while making sure we penciled in plently of time to explore slowly (ie., our weekend in Brighton).  It was so fun wandering around London with my dad on his first trip to Europe; we had some good quailty father-daughter time.  I think this trip may have hooked him.  He&amp;#39;ll be back to Europe again.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, I’ve decided that I’m going to start adding some “tips” to our travel posts.  They’ll be some of our favorite things that we did/ate while we were there and maybe some helpful suggestions, so that others can learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;LONDON TRAVEL TIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We stayed in a neighborhood called Hackney, which is in East London.  The area is more “up and coming”, meaning there’s some nicer areas right next to some not-so-nice areas.  Hackney has some really nice restaurants and shops and it’s cheaper than staying in the center of London, but if you’re planning on going into the center everyday then I’d probably stay a little closer.  The Tube has easy and convenient connections pretty much everywhere, but it can add some time to your day if you’re going far, especially during rush hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best EATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Clapton Hart&lt;/u&gt;: Really good pub food and atmosphere.  They only have a few things on their menu, but they’re all spot on.  I recommend the Bean Burger. We went here twice during the 5 days we were in London, if that tells you anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yum Yum Thai Restaurant&lt;/u&gt;: We had SO much food here and it was all delicious.  But maybe don’t order a Seafood sampler and an entrée each, unless you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hungry, then you should, because your stomach and tastebuds will thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;El Olivo&lt;/u&gt;: My dad says these were the best tapas that he’s ever had.  I don’t know how many times he’s actually had tapas though, so I’m going to vouch for them too.  They were darn good.  And what are tapas without sangria? &lt;em&gt;Get it.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Thing(s) We Did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Parliament House&lt;/u&gt;: I’ll admit, I thought this tour was going to be really lame (I’m pretty particular about tours), but it was actually very interesting.  We did the audio tour and I’d say it was definitely worth it.  It was very well organized and not very crowded (compared to some of the other touristy places). We learned a lot about the history and current happenings of the Parliment.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Football Match&lt;/u&gt;: If you&amp;#39;re into football (soccer) and have a chance, go to a match. It&amp;#39;s quite the experience, the hardcore/rowdy fans really get you into the spirit and you get a little taste of the strong culture around the sport.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember that England likes to be a little unique and has different outlets than the rest of Europe, so make sure you check that you have the right adapters when you go (i.e., be smarter than us).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BRIGHTON TRAVEL TIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Regency Lansdowne Guest House&lt;/u&gt;: Mike, the owner of the B&amp;amp;B, was so incredibly kind and accommodating and prepared a yummy breakfast every morning.  The rooms were very nice and Mike provides you with everything you need…even outlet adapters, for those, &lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;, forgetful travelers.  The house is actually located in Hove, but Brighton and Hove are neighboring towns situated right next to each other.  We walked from our B&amp;amp;B in Hove all the way to the Brighton Pier (and we weren’t huffing and puffing when we got there). An extra plus is that the beach is just a 2 minute walk down the street! You can see it from the steps of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best EATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Archipelagos Taverna&lt;/u&gt;: Some good Greek food can be found here.  I got a Greek salad and an order of baked white beans.  I know, it doesn’t sound all that enticing, but my husband and dad practically ate all the beans off my plate, that’s how good they were.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Thing(s) We Did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take a walk along the beach! We started in Hove (from our B&amp;amp;B) and strolled down the shore, stopping to listen to outdoor karaoke and watch the street performers, until we got to Brighton Pier.  Then we cut back up through the town, winding through the side streets decorated with millions of shops.  Seriously, &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt;.  Then, come evening time, buy yourself a bottle of wine and some sandwich fixin’s and make your way back out to the beach and enjoy the sunset over the water.  It’s all about the beach here.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are looking for a weekend escape, this is the place for you.  There’s not many &lt;em&gt;sites&lt;/em&gt; to see, but there’s plenty of restaurants, shopping and shoreline waiting for you.  We didn’t experience the nightlife, but it looked and sounded like it was pretty lively, at least on the weekends.  Cute little town overall.  &lt;/p&gt;

                        <title>Copenhagen | Round Two</title>
                        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2014/houses.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the thing, the picture above, it’s actually from the first time that I went to Copenhagen with my mom.  This time around we were still traveling with our friends, Kevin and Debrán, and well, the weather was not all that great.  It was pretty chilly and it rained practically the entire time we were there.  That’s not to say that we didn’t have a great time, it’s just that I didn’t really take any pictures.  This time around it wasn’t so much about the sites we saw or even the food we ate (although it was still amazing), the best part of our time in Copenhagen actually revolved around a foosball table.  I’ve never really been a big fan of foosball, probably because I’ve never been very good at it, and it just seemed kind of dumb (probably because I never won).  But Kevin and Debrán wound up with a foosball table in their flat, so after dinner our first night, we decided to give it a try.  After Debrán effortlessly scored the first goal, like she’d been secretly training all her life, we couldn’t stop playing.  I don’t know if it was the dreary weather, or the fact that by game two we all had been nicknamed according to our style of play, or maybe it was the super competitiveness coming out in all of us.  Anyway, we were all hooked.  I’m sure we woke up the neighbors with our fits of laughter and the occasional scream at our teammates, the tiny plastic ones.  So that’s what happened every night, a foosball rematch, until one of the teams barely squeaked out a win (&lt;em&gt;oh, it’s not over yet&lt;/em&gt;).  And it was the best ending to a really great trip.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day we got to Bergen it was pouring rain and pretty darn chilly.  Scott and I came completely unprepared, with no rain jackets and barely any warm clothing.  We had gotten used to the nice warm weather we’d been having way too easily and forgotten that these places require jackets and scarfs for most of the year.  Our traveling buddies, however, came far more prepared than we did.  Which shouldn’t have come as a surprise since they’re always far more prepared than us (&lt;em&gt;that’s why we’re friends&lt;/em&gt;).  We made the decision that we weren’t going to let the rain get in our way of seeing this Norwegian city though.  After all, Bergen has over 230 days of annual rainfall (&lt;em&gt;we found out once we were there&lt;/em&gt;).  So we trudged out into the city with wet clothes and smiles on our faces (sort of).  One of the things that our host warned us about (but definitely not the most shocking) was the high cost of eating at restaurants in Norway.  Most locals cook at home to keep costs down and rarely eat out.  So we followed her advice and went to the fish market to buy our dinner.  After gathering all the supplies to make dinner, we took the short cut back to our place.  This is the other &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt; thing that our host warned us about.  Across the street from the apartment that we were renting, was a well known drug park.  Everyone knew it, even the police, and apparently they had made the decision to leave all the druggies be, as long as they kept to the park.  We were warned that we would see all kinds of &lt;em&gt;crrrrazy&lt;/em&gt; stuff going on in the park.  &lt;em&gt;It’s like your own private show, right outside your window,&lt;/em&gt; she explained, laughing. We all laughed with her.  Then when she left we looked at each other, completely stunned.  Not exactly the kind of welcoming we had imagined.  But then we laughed again, for real this time, and took the long way to the market.  Well on the way back it was raining, like really raining, and we were carrying heavy bags of groceries.  So we opted for the short cut through the park, after all, she assured us it was completely safe.  &lt;em&gt;Don’t look at them, walk fast, but not too fast, act like we’re talking&lt;/em&gt;…these were the things we reminded each other of before embarking on the 2 minute walk through the park.  &lt;em&gt;Ok, we’re almost there.  Which way is it?  I think it’s this way.  Wait, maybe it’s that way.  Just keep walking!&lt;/em&gt; - as we basically slid down a steep muddy hill, which was clearly not the path to our apartment.   But looking lost in the middle of the drug park was not an option, so we acted as if we needed a good challenge.  Sidewalks bore us.  We successfully made it back, after what seemed like 2 &lt;em&gt;very long&lt;/em&gt; minutes.  We earned some serious bravery points for that, I’m sure.  I mean, no big deal, we’re hardcore.                     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our first day there, mother nature pleasantly surprised us with lots of sun and very minimal rain.  I think that I can speak for the group when I say that the best part of our stay in Bergen was the day we took the ferry through the Sognefjord.  To get to the fjord we took a train and a bus through some of the most stunning landscapes I’ve ever seen.  The kind that that make it on postcards.  It was unreal.  But the ferry through the fjord was definitely the cherry on top.  The greenest greens and the bluest blues you’ve ever seen.  Waterfalls every time you turned your head.  Mountains coming straight out of the river, on both sides, decorated every so often with a tiny cluster of houses.  Better than the pictures.  It was, without a doubt, worth &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; walks through the drug park.                     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this next round of travels, not only did we have some exciting Scandinavian cities to visit, but we also had some of our favorite people join us!  We met Kevin and Debrán in Stockholm to start the trip and, despite their luggage getting lost by the airlines, it was a pretty great kickoff.  We decided that the best way to see the city (and save our feet) was to join the hordes of commuting bike riders.  On our first day with the bikes we took them exploring through one of the many islands which was, apparently, one of the &lt;em&gt;cool kid&lt;/em&gt; hangouts during the summer.  Stockholm is pretty cool like that.  They have all these random, &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; parks all over the place where you can find pretty much the entire population of the city on a nice summer evening.  So we followed suit and did our fair share of sitting, laying, picnic-ing on the grass, soaking up as much of summer as these Scandinavian countries offer.  Then we fantasized about buying one of those adorable houses on the water and going on bike rides everyday around the islands, picking fresh apples and maybe even building up the courage to swim in the frigid water. Yeah, I know, I do that everywhere I go.  I can’t help it, I like to dream.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark has definitely made its way onto my list of “places I could live”.  The food really helped give it a good shove up the list.  I still daydream about it.  Scott and I have become major porridge fans since living in Finland and Copenhagen has a restaurant dedicated SOLELY to porridge. Score! But it’s really more than just food (although that might be enough to make me move there).  Everything is just so…pretty.  They’ve really got that whole Scandinavian design thing going for them.  Copenhagen has all that you could want in a big city without feeling too big.  And when you want to escape from all the fuss of the city, well you can just have a picnic in the cemetery, like we did.  To tell you the truth, I was a little skeptical about this whole idea at first, but the first time we walked through and saw locals running, sun bathing and enjoying their lunch, I was convinced.  It’s basically a giant park.  And what better way to use such a space on a sunny afternoon, than a picnic.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people in Denmark also helped make it so wonderful.  They are so down to earth and friendly, which really worked in my favor, since I had a couple of &lt;em&gt;moments&lt;/em&gt; during our time there.  It started the first day we were in Copenhagen. After our first super delicious meal, I left my jacket (the only one I brought) at the restaurant.  We were mid-way through the Superkilen park when I realized (and panicked).  I walked just about as fast as I could, without looking like a lunatic, back to the restaurant.  Luckily, my jacket was waiting for me just inside the door.  The second time I tested the Danes was while we were walking to the canals.  On the way we decided to pop into in several boutique-y shops.  Well, I found a really nice piece of pottery and I wanted to see how much it cost.  So I picked it up.  Unfortunately there were two pieces to this particular item and I only picked up the top part.  After that, all I remember is the entire thing on the floor, in a million pieces.  (Although I did manage to see the price, which was equivalent to $100.)  First, the sweet woman working looked stunned, like she didn’t know what to do.  (Probably because nothing like that had ever happened before…oops.) Then she quickly went to clean it up and told us not to worry about it.  After helping her clean, I could not get out of the store fast enough.  The rest of the trip I had someone looking over my shoulder to make sure I wasn’t touching anything breakable, &lt;em&gt;thanks mom&lt;/em&gt;.  The last little mishap, was not so little after all.  See, I bought train tickets from Copenhagen to Aarhus. Or at least I thought I did.  And what does one do when they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they buy train tickets? Well, they get on the train.  Turns out (after three different people tried to figure out &lt;em&gt;what in the world&lt;/em&gt; was going on with our tickets) I had bought bus tickets instead.  &lt;em&gt;Whoops&lt;/em&gt;.  But we were already on the train on our way to Aarhus.  So thankfully, the super kind ticket checker let us slide.  I told you those Danes were nice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that I made such a good impression on them, soon they&amp;#39;ll be begging me to move there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so exciting to get to show someone around where you live.  Although tons of people have seen pictures and heard stories, nothing beats seeing it in person.  There’s not many “sights” to see in Joensuu so when I was showing my mom around the city it was more like, “This is the grocery store we go to” and “Here’s the university” and “Look, those are the people washing their rugs at the river”.  Luckily, my mom is into that kind of stuff.  She will get equally as excited about visiting a new grocery store as she would about seeing the Eiffel Tower - so that worked in my favor.  And the rug washing, well she was ALL about that.  I had this old rug of ours that had been sitting on our balcony for months (because I was too lazy to take it downstairs to throw it away) that had a giant red stain on it that would not come out.  (Seriously, I tried everything).  Even after it had been rained and snowed on, my mom was convinced that the rug was salvageable with a good ole scrub at the river.  After studying the ways of the river washers and scouting out a perfect spot, we hauled the rug out.  Once we got to our spot and began mimicking the routine of the other washers, we realized we had a big problem.  Everyone else had these special rug brushes and pine soap that seemed to do the trick, and all we had was my dish scrubber and dish washing soap.  In attempt to act like we knew what we were doing, we hid the soap inside our bag and began scrubbing.  Except we couldn’t fool the lady next to us.  She saw right through our act.  Fortunately, she took pity on us and let us use all her gear while she was waiting for her rug to dry.  She even taught us the ways of the Finnish rug scrub.  We scrubbed that rug like mad until we couldn’t scrub anymore.  Then we waited all day to return to see if our hard work had paid off.  And it did!! I’m not going to say that the rug is as good as new, because if you looked hard enough (ok, you don’t even have to look that hard), you can still see a little discoloration.  But we just shoved that part under the couch and pretend it’s not there.  What would I do without mom to save the day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we took the train from my small, sweet town of Joensuu to the big city.  I’d been to Helsinki a number of times before, but you just can’t beat it in the summertime.  Especially when you spend the day at one of the many islands off the coast, like we did.  It was a bright, sunny and warm day that we took the ferry out to Suomenlinna and spent the day exploring the island and enjoying the weather.  It was perfect.  Although Suomenlinna is one of Helsinki’s most popular tourist attractions, it’s still Finland, so really not that touristy at all.  We found a place on the rocks to watch all the crazy people plunge into the ice water.  And because I’m kind of, maybe just a little bit competitive, I decided that I wanted to feel how cold this water really was.  I mean, if they’re doing it, I can do it.  As I started walking to the water, my mom, in true mom fashion, warned me to be careful on the moss, “It’s slippery”, she said.  &lt;em&gt;Yeah, yeah.&lt;/em&gt;  When I got to the edge of the dry rocks and put one foot on the first mossy rock, I was reminded that moms are usually right.  I slipped and fell right into the water.  So instead of just touching it with my hands, like I intended, I got a little more of the full experience.  Luckily, I wasn’t very far in and I didn’t hurt anything, so we just laughed about it for a good long while. That&amp;#39;s really why I did it, for the laughs.                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome seems like such a long time ago.  I guess it’s because we’ve been so many places since then.  The words that come to my head when I think back on our time in Rome are: hot, gelato and ancient.  I think that pretty much sums it up.  The daily routine went something like this - visit ancient building and/or church, marvel at how old and amazing it is, start getting really hot, escape to a restaurant for some AC, walk around some more, get hot again, eat gelato, eat pizza or pasta, repeat.  Mmmm…gelato.        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of those who have prayed, hoped and wished for warm weather to make its way to Finland, thank you, it has.  Now if we could work on a little AC up in here, that’d be really cool (no pun intended). I am so thankful for and loving all this warm weather and sunshine that we’ve been getting, really I am.  Everyone is happy, people are out and about and picnics are happening all over the city.  It’s the best.  But when it’s 80+ outside and you have to be inside, with no AC, well let’s just say if it weren’t for the mosquitos I’d be sleeping in the forest.  When the wind blows our door closed, I sprint to prop it back open to prevent an immediate pool of sweat and suffocation.  I have my fly swatter (thanks mom) ready at all times in case one of those annoying creatures tries to sneak their way through the open windows and doors.  But I know that sooner than I care to admit the chilling winds will be back again and open windows won’t even be an option, so I’m going to turn that fan on high and keep reminding myself that it’s better than frozen eyelashes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a little over a month ago we took a trip to Paris for a week with Scott’s parents.  I’m going to blame the fact that I’m just now writing about it on the mere three weeks that I’ve spent in Joensuu since the beginning of June AND my little motivation to do anything that involves my legs sticking to a chair while staring at a computer.  Yep, that’s my excuse.  My idea of Paris was pretty much the same one that is portrayed on TV.  Beautiful, wonderful, romantic…just about everything perfect squished into one city.  There’s so much hype around the city that I thought there was no way it could live up to my (and many people’s) expectations.  But as cliché as it sounds, I did kind of fall just a little bit in love with the city.  The museums, churches and Eiffel Tower are all amazing, but what I really loved was the everyday kind of stuff.  Like the millions of cafés lining every street, filled with people enjoying the weather and good company.  And the parks, or just dots of green, for people to bring their picnics of baguettes, cheese and a bottle of wine (yes, that actually happens in real life).  Oh, and all the buildings.  I just couldn’t get enough of the white-grayish old buildings that give the city it’s relaxed, romantic feel.  It also didn’t hurt that we had near perfect weather the entire time we were there, which really makes everything better.  I don’t know what it is about the city. You can do nothing except sit at a café and people-watch, and at the end of the day you still feel like you’ve had a pretty solid day.  But that’s what’s so great about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 5:00 am, rolled out of bed, stumbled downstairs to pick up our carefully packed breakfast and began our journey to Gdańsk.  The first 2 hours on the bus were pretty silent.  Occasionally you could hear a short mumbled conversation, but for the most far it was silent, with heads bobbing up and down, trying desperately to get more sleep.  As we arrived in Gdańsk, heads began to perk up and eyes were peeled open to take in the new city.  Our first stop was a boat ride and tour of some of the historical WWII sites.  Seeing the city by boat was a fun new perspective as we watched people enjoying the warm sun and the colorful waterfront buildings pass by.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a big helping of pierogi (Polish dumplings) for lunch, we spent some time walking around the city, marveling at the beautiful churches and mesmerizing buildings.  Gdańsk is known as the capital of amber, with tons of street vendors displaying an array of jewelry made with the Baltic gold, so of course we couldn’t leave without some time spent shopping.  Our last stop, before heading back, was a quick trip to the beach on the Baltic Sea.  The beach was packed with people lounging in padded beach chairs, under umbrellas and a few brave souls who ventured out to the frigid water.  We left Gdańsk beat from the long, action-packed day, while simultaneously craving more time in the lively port town.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with all that the city had to offer from the rich history, the cheerful old town and the lovely beaches.  I couldn’t help but think about what a perfect weekend getaway destination it would be.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, YAY we’re back in Joensuu!  The past month has been full of fun times and great memories, but I sure was ready to be back in my own bed.  The first two weeks of the trip I was in Toruń, Poland working with students from three other countries on an intensive summer course.  The topic was building intercultural awareness in teaching English as a foreign language.  We arrived late Sunday night after a 4.5 hour train to Helsinki, 2 hour flight to Warsaw and then a 4 hour bus ride to Toruń.  Then early Monday morning we were up for the beginning of ten long days in class (don&amp;#39;t worry, we managed to squeeze in some time for fun).  There were nine other students from UEF that went on the trip, so I got to make some pretty great friends as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about Poland.  Go there.  Seriously, it’s such an interesting, beautiful country filled with so much history.  In Toruń there was a wonderful Old Town filled with ornate, colorful buildings that I could just stare at all day (maybe that’s why I have so many pictures of them).  And because we were studying with Polish students, we also got to learn a lot about Polish culture. For instance, what I would call ‘lunch’ they refer to as ‘dinner’ and it’s eaten at around 1 pm.  The meal generally consists of three courses and starts with a soup, then you have the entrée, which is usually some sort of meat and potatoes, and then a dessert.  Later you have ‘supper’ which is around 6 pm and is generally some form of sandwich.  Being in Poland, we followed the same daily meal schedule.  I always find it interesting to learn about other food cultures.  I think you can tell a lot about a culture from how and what they eat.  We also learned a little about Nicolaus Copernicus, who is the pride and joy of Toruń.  There&amp;#39;s a statue of him in the center of the old town and the univeristy, where we were studying, is named after him.  As our welcoming gift, we all got Nicolaus Copernicus zip drives!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we were in class a lot, there were still plenty late nights hanging out with new friends from Spain, France, Poland (and of course, Finland).  That was the best part of the trip.  Just talking, laughing and being with those people.  After two weeks of cramming in a ridiculous amount of work and play, I was completely worn out, but it was so so worth it.           &lt;/p&gt;
