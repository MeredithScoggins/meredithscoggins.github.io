          <title>I Have No Idea What I'm Doing</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;No Idea&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.15+I+have+no+idea+what+I%27m+doing/I+have+no+idea+what+I%27m+doing-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During life&amp;#39;s ebbs and flows I go through stages where I feel like I have no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing.  I begin to question all my past decisions and stress about all the future ones.  I start to panic about the imminent occasion where I will have to, once again, make a (relatively) important decision about what my life will look like.  I feel lost.  As if everything is closing in on me and I can&amp;#39;t see out.  I attempt to claw my way out by laying out some options and forcing myself to make a hasty decision on the matter.  Occasionally it works temporarily and I begin to feel the sufficating sensation slip away, but it usually comes back, even stronger than before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of insisting that I have to have a plan, and I’m tired of feeling I have to be confident that whatever it is that I’m doing or going to do is going to end up a certain way.  I’m not.  I actually have no idea what I’m doing on a daily basis, much less what I’m going to do in the future.  &lt;em&gt;Not. A. Clue.&lt;/em&gt;  I’m just trying out some things as I go.  &lt;em&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t we all?&lt;/em&gt;  Sometimes they work out like I plan, but a lot of times they end up completely different than I could have ever imagined.  And then there’s the times they’re just an altogether failure.  The kind that leave you wondering if you’ll ever do anything meaningful with your life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to know what the end will be before I actually get there.  I want to be certain that risking embarrassment, vulnerability, and hard work is going to be worth it in the end.  Sometimes at particularly suspenseful moments while I’m reading, I can’t prevent my eyes from drifting to the bottom of the page to find out how it’s all going to work out, before I get too invested.  I have big, crazy dreams, and occasionally some pretty outlandish thoughts, but I’m scared to start them because the truth is, I don’t know how it’s all going to go.  There’s so much I don’t know.  &lt;em&gt;Where do I start?  Is this the right way?  Am I doing it all wrong?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if the choices that I’ve made and continue to make are the right ones.  I don’t know if it’s all going to come back around to bite me someday.  I have no idea what my life’s going to look like - not next year, next month, or even tomorrow.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it weighs on me, the fact that I don’t have a plan.  I don’t have it all together like I (foolishly) thought I would when I was younger.  It’s all just a big chaotic mess, really.  Straying this way and that way.  Making the best possible decisions that I can make in the moment.  Taking it one day at a time, sometimes one hour at a time, and that’s ok (at least that’s what I tell myself on the good days).  I&amp;#39;m doing okay.  There&amp;#39;s still so much to learn and so much to do.  It&amp;#39;s in the times when I finally take a breath and let my plans drift away with the wind, that I feel so much better.  It&amp;#39;s a daily struggle to loosen the tight grip I have on those plans.  Then to ultimately allow them to slip from my grasp, that&amp;#39;s where the true feat lies.  We don’t have to have it altogether, and I am tired of convincing myself that I&amp;#39;m supposed to act like I do.  So there it is.  Even in the times it seems like everything’s all perfectly lined up and going wonderfully, I really have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m just going to keep doing it.        &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>An Unexpected Refuge in Colchagua Wine Region</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucked away in the foothills of the Andes Mountains in San Fernando, Chile is the coziest lodge.  The instant you pull into the property you can feel your shoulders drop and you begin breathing a little deeper.  Walking up to the lodge you’re greeted by two friendly Saint Bernards who then escort you to the door.  You’re shown to one of four rooms to drop of your luggage before joining the others for a glass of wine by the fire.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we settled in I knew that we had haphazardly stumbled upon something special.  To be honest, I didn’t really know what to expect when we booked our stay.  We chose the lodge for its affordable rooms and its proximity to wineries and hiking trails.  The experience we had was far beyond anything I imagined.  Every single detail of your experience at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumunanlodge.com/&quot;&gt;Tumuñan Lodge&lt;/a&gt; has been carefully thought out by Will and Carolina, the couple who built and expertly run this little oasis.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our stay, Will spent time talking to us about all the different wines in the region and his personal process in starting his own vineyard on the property.  One day he organized a trip for us to explore the impressive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museocolchagua.cl/&quot;&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Cruz, a delicious seafood lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vino-bello.com/en/27861/ristorante&quot;&gt;Ristorante Vino Bello&lt;/a&gt;, and a tour of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neyenwine.com/Home&quot;&gt;Neyen Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; where we learned more about the wine making process.  Carolina prepared absolutely incredible food at every meal.  I don’t know if I can truly pick a favorite because it was all so delicious, but the beef stew was particularly amazing (and I’m not usually that much of a beef fan).  Because there are only four rooms in the lodge everything can be and is tailored to your needs and desires.  The day that we went on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://coatsandkahvi.com/2016/08/04/Hiking-the-Andes-Mountains.html&quot;&gt;hike&lt;/a&gt; they packed a picnic lunch for us to enjoy while we were out and, we ended up rounding off the day with a wine tasting at the lodge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Colchagua Wine Region&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.10+Colchagua+Wine+Region/Tun%CC%83man+Lodge-14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really loved about Tumuñan Lodge was that you could make your stay whatever you wanted it to be - a relaxing getaway spent with wine and good books, a place to explore the bountiful nature in the valley, or a retreat after a day of visiting wineries in the area.  I was so blown away by our experience at Tumuñan Lodge - the service and the attention to detail were top-notch.  So if you’re looking to explore Chile’s wine regions or just looking for a quiet weekend getaway, you don’t want to miss out on this place.  I’d go back in a heartbeat.  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Unknown</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Unknown&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.08.08+The+Unknown/The+Unknown-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wandering around in search of something and nothing at all,&lt;br&gt; 
finding the most unexpected treasures along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads were windy, with sharp turns and the occasional dead end,&lt;br&gt;
I once stumbled upon a tiny footpath, barely visible from the outside.&lt;br&gt;
The footprints had long been covered with dirt and leaves,&lt;br&gt;
but I knew that someone had been there before.&lt;br&gt;
I imagined what they felt as they turned into the thick forest,&lt;br&gt;
clearing the brush as they slowly inched forward,&lt;br&gt; 
making a path where there had been none before.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;Why here?&lt;br&gt; 
What made them leave the road that had been so carefully laid out before them?&lt;br&gt;
Were they in search of something or did they knowingly brave the unknown?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As thousands of questions swirled around in my mind,&lt;br&gt;
I turned to the right, starring into the deep woods off the long forgotten path.&lt;br&gt;
I wanted to feel what they must have felt as they wandered into uncharted territory,&lt;br&gt;
As I took my first step, my foot sank unto the soft soil, the unruly branches brushed my bare legs and I inhaled the intoxicating scent of life all around me.&lt;br&gt;
Without any warning my legs propelled me forward,&lt;br&gt; 
deeper and deeper into the forest until I could no longer hear anything but birds quiet songs and leaves rustling in the wind.&lt;br&gt;
I kept going, following my instincts, letting curiosity lead the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long I noticed that it was getting dark.&lt;br&gt; 
I came to a sudden stop and instantly felt lost.&lt;br&gt;
In the same place where I had found passion, I now felt intense fear.&lt;br&gt;
Something began to scream at me, urging me to go home,&lt;br&gt;
to go back to the well lit path where it was safe and I knew the way.&lt;br&gt;
The voice got louder and louder - I couldn’t think.&lt;br&gt;
Panic set in.&lt;br&gt; 
I started to run, wildly, frantically, as the darkness swallowed everything around me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same moment I caught a glimpse of the tiniest flash of light.&lt;br&gt;
My legs stopped moving.&lt;br&gt;
I took a deep breath, exhaling slowly.&lt;br&gt;
A blanket of calm wrapped itself around my shoulders and brought warmth deep into my bones.&lt;br&gt;
I looked around, once again admiring the untouched nature flourishing around me.&lt;br&gt;
Curiosity began to creep back in until it found its way into every empty space inside me.&lt;br&gt;
I heard another voice, this time much quieter, almost in a whisper,&lt;br&gt;
reminding me that I was not lost, that nothing had changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that this was the same place that I had been all along,&lt;br&gt; 
only now it was covered in the disguise of darkness.&lt;br&gt; 
But darkness is nothing to fear,&lt;br&gt;
it invites you in just the same, to take risks and discover&lt;br&gt;
all it asks for is a mind that is open to the unknown and a gentle heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night will come, making it harder to find the way,&lt;br&gt;
but you are not left in complete darkness&lt;br&gt;
afterall, that&amp;#39;s what the moon and the stars are for.&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Hiking the Andes Mountains</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rained, no, it poured, all day for two days straight before we saw a gap in the forecast that might allow us to explore these mountains in our backyard.  Although we were thoroughly enjoying the days spent drinking wine by the fire, we were staying right in the foothills of the Andes and were anxious to get out and see the outdoors.  So as soon as we saw a rain-free day we planned to make the most of it and spend the day hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a very rough map in hand we started out packed with food, water, and extra layers.  The first stop on our map was a waterfall hidden amongst a bamboo forest.  We walked towards the crescendo of rushing water as we parted the sticks of bamboo moving steadily through the forest.  Once we spent significant time admiring the unique beauty of the lagoon, we continued on our way passing through sections of thick forest to wide open spaces where the vastness of the mountains was undeniable.  Almost every half hour one of us gawked at the incredible view before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple hours in we had (unbeknownst to us at the time) completed the leisurely part and had begun to feel the effects of the hike creeping up our legs.  Our shoes were completely caked in mud to the point that I had to stop every 15 feet to scrap off the excess mud.  We climbed higher and higher, up steeper and steeper inclines, taking slow, methodical steps in the deep mud.  After a particularly grueling climb we were met with the most incredible view looking out at all the mountain peaks around and below us.  Standing there in awe of the beauty we &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; forgot about our aching legs.  We were convinced that the hard part was behind us and the remainder of the hike would be a breeze, nothing more than a peaceful stroll through the trees.  As you might have guessed, we were wildly mistaken.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told before departing that there would be a small river that we would cross on our way back and this would be a key landmark to let us know that we were on the right track. Well, as I mentioned before, the previous days had been full of non-stop showers.  So instead of the one small river we were supposed to find, we found ourselves head-to-toe with quite a few “rivers”.  We had been walking for a while now without any real indication that we were on the right path or how far away from home we were.  Time after time we crossed over (or through) extra full rivers with sparse stepping stones, trying our hardest not to end up with soaking wet clothes.  At one point, after crossing our fingers extra tight that we had passed all of the rivers, we came across yet another one that completely immobilized us.  We stood there on one side of the rushing stream scanning for any possible rocks peaking out of water, but there were none.  Not one.  So we looked from side to side, trying to figure out another way to get to the other side.  To the left the only possible way over was engulfed in thorny bushes on both sides of the stream.  To the right were wild bushes, trees, and more thorns.  There wasn’t a good option.  But we had to get across, that was the only thing we were certain about.  Scott went first, pushing his way through the bushes of thorns to the right.  I followed, still unsure if this attempt would be successful.  We made slow progress, trying not to get whacked in the face by branches and keeping an extra eye out for the swarms of thorns all around us.  Finally, only slightly wet and with no major encounters with thorns, we successfully made it to the other side and continued on our way (passing more and more streams along the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking the Andes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.30+Hiking+the+Andes+Mountains/Hiking+the+Andes-9.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost 5:00, about an hour before sunset and still not exactly sure how much longer we had left, when I stopped dead in my tracks.  A lone horse, with a deep chestnut coat, stood still just a few feet in front of us.  We walked slowly towards him, careful not to make any quick movements, and as we did three other horses appeared from behind the trees.  It felt as if we were walking into a dream.  They seemed to come from no where and belong to no one.  As we turned the corner to follow the trail, several unhappy dogs approached, breaking the spell of the majestic horses.  They stayed on our heels as we tried to calm them and leave their territory.  All of the sudden, seemingly out of nowhere, a man grumbled something, quieting the dogs.  We turned to the left and there was a small man, dressed casually in sweatpants and a light coat, approaching from a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHzysxXgedR/?taken-by=meredithspetit&quot;&gt;wooden cabin&lt;/a&gt;.  Since the trail had been completely devoid of any other humans I was completely taken aback by seeing another person and especially in this kind of situation.  Right after I turned to say hello, I noticed there was a herd of goats huddled together near a pen higher up the mountain.  I asked if I could take a picture of his goats and as soon as I did he responded with “Tengo jovenes atrás” (&lt;em&gt;I have babies back there&lt;/em&gt;).  He didn’t ask me to, but I followed him back into the muddy pen to find twenty baby &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHzUxyXgqVn/?taken-by=meredithspetit&quot;&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt;, some as young as a few days old, vying for attention.  I wanted to stay longer, but the sun was setting fast and we still had a ways to go.  The moment that magical scene was out of sight I was reliving it in my mind, like it was all a wonderful, enchanting dream.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story could go one forever with me recounting every small little moment that seemed so monumental at the time, but I’ll wrap it up.  We walked until we hit a dead end and were pretty sure we had taken a wrong turn somewhere.  It was sunset and I was panicking.  There was no one to ask, no where else to go, so we turned and retraced our steps until we once again heard the sound of rushing water.  We followed the sound to the top of a waterfall, the same one that we had visited at the beginning of our trek in the morning.  This was not where we were supposed to be, but at least it was something familiar.  The only thing we felt sure about in the moment was that we needed to be on the other side of the waterfall and then we could find our way home.  Our shoes were muddy, slippery and the rocks were covered in water, but we took a deep breath, stretched our legs out as far as they could reach and lunged from rock to rock until we finally landed on the other side.  The relief that I felt was so immense that it was as if we had just been through a life or death situation through the depths of highly dangerous white water rapids.  It was exaggerated for sure, but dang it felt good.  And so did that warm shower and glass of wine waiting for us when we made it back home.      &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A Harbour Sunrise</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Valparaiso&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.26+Valparaiso+%7C+A+Photo+Journal/Valparaiso-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago we took a week-long winter vacation and traveled in the central region of Chile.  One of our stops along the way was Valparaíso, a coastal town not too far from Santiago.  When you arrive in Valparaíso it is as if you have traveled to another country entirely.  It&amp;#39;s unlike anywhere else I have been in Chile, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  The town is filled with quirkiness and is most known for it&amp;#39;s abundance of street art that covers almost every building.  It&amp;#39;s sensory overload, in the best way.  We spent our short time there just wandering around, up and down all the hills, taking it all in (&lt;em&gt;that and eating a lot&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port of Valparaíso, although less talked about, is an important part of the city&amp;#39;s history.  In the early 1800&amp;#39;s the city&amp;#39;s harbour opened the possibility for international trade and was a major stopping point for ships making their way around South America.  Although the impact of the harbour has decreased over the years, you can still feel the sense of life it brings to the city from its shores.  We got up early one morning to watch the boats coming and going and got to be a part of the awakening of the city.  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>More Than Just a Pair of Shoes</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Clothes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was walking home from the supermarket and I glanced down at my very worn in boots that had become soaked by the rain, and all of the sudden a thousand memories flooded my mind.  Memories of the places that they&amp;#39;ve taken me, both the incredible and the tough times that they&amp;#39;ve seen, and all the stories that they could tell came rushing towards me faster than I could process. Traveling has forced me to make purposeful decisions about my clothes, taking into account their flexibilty amongst different seasons, practicality, comfort, and style.  When I got home and put my boots away in the closet I took a quick scan of my clothes to see if anything else stood out to me as particularly meaningful.  When I did, I noticed that there were several key pieces in my wardrobe that I continue to reach for again and again no matter where we are.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Clothes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Clothes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see by the pictures, these pieces have been very loved over time.  They&amp;#39;re faded, they have stains, tears, and small rips, but that doesn&amp;#39;t stop me from wearing them regularly.  In the past, as soon as my clothes got a stain or small tear I would toss them to the side and find something else to replace them, but now I see what a waste that was.  It&amp;#39;s the ones with imperfections that are the guardians of the stories and cherished memories.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at my water-stained boots with worn toes, I am reminded of those first few months after we arrived in Finland and I quickly realized that my Texas wardrobe was not going to cut it in the fridgid north.  So I sought out to find something that would keep my feet warm and be comfortable enough to wear on a regular basis (before I was forced to wear snow boots full-time) and I finally found some that fit the bill. I stressed over that first scratch, trying to diguise it and erase it from sight.  Now, after countless scratches and stains, each new one only adds character and a new chapter to their story.  Those boots felt the first snow of our first winter in Joensuu, they collected crumbs while I indulged in countless mouth-watering pastries in Paris, they protected me from the fierce winds on the Irish coast, and now they carry me the two blocks to school everyday in Chile.           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Clothes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.07.05+My+Most+Loved+Clothes/travel+clothes-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this post is not really about my shoes, or any of my clothes for that matter, it&amp;#39;s about the stories that they hold deep in their fabrics.  I&amp;#39;ve always been one that loves to drag out the old family albums to reminisce and relive old memories.  I think that&amp;#39;s why photography speaks to me so much, it allows me to capture those moments in time, happy or sad, and feel them no matter how much time has past.  It&amp;#39;s the stories that I really cherish, and my boots are just a reminder to keep pursuring memories.  Sometimes I lose sight, but I know that in the end it&amp;#39;s the stories that will last, not the stuff.  So this is just a reminder to myself, &lt;em&gt;keep pursuring memories, you won&amp;#39;t regret it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What brings back those cherished memories for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>How to make a Pisco Sour</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Pisco Sour&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.21+Pisco+Sour/Pisco+Sour-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The century-long debate between Chile and Peru over who should get all the credit for introducing the world to this tangy cocktail we call pisco sour, is still going strong today.  I don&amp;#39;t think it will ever truly be settled.  Neither country wants to give the other one the credit for their national drink.  And I don&amp;#39;t blame them.  It&amp;#39;s pretty dang delicious so I&amp;#39;d probably fight over claim to it too.  Either way, whether it was Peru or Chile who put this drink on the map, I thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Pisco Sour&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.21+Pisco+Sour/Pisco+Sour-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Pisco Sour&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.21+Pisco+Sour/Pisco+Sour-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been in Chile for over two months now, I think it goes without saying that the pisco sour and I have been introduced.  In fact we&amp;#39;ve been out on a couple of dates.  So I feel moderately qualified in identifying a good one.  Although I have tried it several times, we had yet to make one ourselves until last weekend.  The best one we&amp;#39;ve had so far was a homemade version that a friend of ours made for Scott&amp;#39;s birthday, so we set out to follow his advice to make the best pisco sour.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His primary advice in making it top notch was to use fresh lemon juice.  You can sub for the bottled stuff, but it just won&amp;#39;t be quite as good.  Other than that, it&amp;#39;s best to use powdered sugar as your sweetner, rather than table sugar, since the extra fine texture allows it to blend much better with the rest of the liquids. Now that you&amp;#39;ve got all that down, it&amp;#39;s easy.  You&amp;#39;re ready to whip up one of your own and bring a little taste of Chile (or Peru) to your table.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Pisco Sour&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.21+Pisco+Sour/Pisco+Sour-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;recipe-details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PISCO SOUR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes 1 drink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measurements based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pisco-sour-234357&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.5 ounces of Chilean pisco (about 1.5 shots)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/4 ounce of lemon juice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/2 ounce of powdered sugar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 egg white&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mix everything in a blender or cocktail shaker. Pour and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;**Notes: We used a blender, but the egg white makes it really foamy so I'd recommend using a cocktail shaker if you have one.  Either way it's still delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <title>My Favorite Time of the Day</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Sunrise&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.16+My+favorite+time+of+the+day/sunrise-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the silence of the morning I can hear my heart,&lt;br&gt;
I can feel the longing of my soul&lt;br&gt;
and I can once again see clearly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the world wakes, time slows down.&lt;br&gt;
Deadlines and schedules do not exist. &lt;br&gt;
All sense of urgency seems to be forgotten.&lt;br&gt;
Time is marked solely by the slow pour of fresh coffee &lt;br&gt;
and the gentle awakening of the sun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds of my mind are parted and quickly evaporate,&lt;br&gt;
making way for the light, once again.&lt;br&gt;
With the light comes a sense of calmness, of clarity, and eagerness.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#39;m given another chance.&lt;br&gt;
The ability to move forward with courage and passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the light intensifies, the clouds begin to creep back in.&lt;br&gt;
Slowly at first and I&amp;#39;m able to fight them off, &lt;br&gt;
desperately clinging to the last drop of light.&lt;br&gt;
Soon they out number me and I can hold them off no longer.&lt;br&gt;
The clock starts its rhythmic ticking.&lt;br&gt;
The beat of my heart is swallowed by the clicking of keyboards and the voices of strangers.&lt;br&gt;
I feel lost and I can&amp;#39;t find a way out.&lt;br&gt;
I search for the sun, for the silence, but it&amp;#39;s nowhere to be found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single ray of light escapes the thick cover of the clouds and warms my skin.&lt;br&gt;
For a brief moment I am brought back from the fog with thoughts of the morning.&lt;br&gt;
Tomorrow will come and bring with it the stillness in my soul.&lt;br&gt;
I will wait. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Unwinding at Los Pozones Hot Springs</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to think of a day that sounds more relaxing than soaking in a natural hot springs surrounded by autumn-colored trees and a cool breeze.  There are endless ways to expend your energy amongst the lakes and mountains in this region, so it only seems fitting that nature gives us a way to relax and unwind as well.  Last weekend we traded in our hiking gear for swimsuits and headed out to spend the afternoon at one of the many hot springs just outside of Pucón.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-19.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-27.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Villarrica is a great base to take advantage of pretty much everything you could want to do around here.  It’s just a short bus trip from Pucón, where you can catch buses that take you to the national parks, the volcano, and the hot springs.  We decided to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.termaslospozones.cl/&quot;&gt;Los Pozones&lt;/a&gt; hot springs after it was recommended to us by several people for the peaceful atmosphere it offered, tucked in a beautiful forest amongst the streams and tall trees.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the hot springs offer food and drinks in addition to other amenities, but this spot is kept wonderfully natural with only the springs and a changing room.  We took a short break to eat the simple lunch we packed, but other than that we spent the entire time just soaking in the crystal clear water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-25.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hot Springs&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.05+A+Day+at+the+Hot+Springs/Los+Pozones-22.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occasional cool breeze provided a welcomed balance to the steamy water throughout the day.  Although I felt like I could spend an eternity there, my body knew it needed a break after a few hours.  We reluctantly left the tranquility of the water, put our coats back on and headed back up the hill to catch the bus back to Pucón. I felt like I was in a dream as we walked up the steep incline to find the mountain tops completely engulfed in wispy clouds. With its close proximately to Villarrica, we will surely be back soon to experience another afternoon as relaxing as that one.        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

          <title>Life in Chile</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Life in Chile&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.06.02+Life+in+Chile/Life+in+Chile-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going about daily life here in Chile, posting every so often over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/meredithspetit/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; without giving you a proper introduction to our new town and life.  So let me back up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Chile a little over a month ago and have been settled into our new town of Villarrica for about four weeks.  Villarrica is a mid-sized town in the center of southern Chile.  As I mentioned in my last post, Villarrica sits on a beautiful lake flanked by mountains and volcanos.  On the other side of the lake is Pucón, Villarrica’s more tourist-friendly neighbor.  The area is known for its access to nature and outdoor adventures (hiking, canoeing, hot springs, rafting, skiing, and so much more), which we are steadily working on checking off our list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made our home in Villarrica in a quaint wooden cabin, just two blocks from the lake (and less than two blocks from my school).  We are learning so many new things through our adventures in cabin life, like how to keep a fire going all day (and all night), and what to do when you run out of propane in the middle of cooking dinner on your gas stove.  Reminds me of some of the fond &lt;a href=&quot;http://coatsandkahvi.com/2013/09/03/our-new-apartment.html&quot;&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt; we have figuring out life in Finland.  One of the best things about our cabin is that we have a view of the Villarrica Volcano from our porch.  Every day on my way to work I get to glance over at the ever-changing peak - sometimes clear and calm, while at other times surrounded by smoke or looming clouds.  That incredible sight never gets old.  Another thing that I love about where we are living is that we walk to everything - the supermarket, the laundry, our favorite pizza place, the lake, and my school.  It’s just one of those small joys that makes the everyday a little bit more pleasantly simple.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this just being a wonderful little town, everyone has also been so welcoming and kind to us.  People seem to go out of their way to help the &lt;em&gt;gringos&lt;/em&gt; figure out how to do things around here.  Especially our adoptive Chilean &lt;em&gt;padres&lt;/em&gt; who make sure that we get our filling of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado&quot;&gt;asado&lt;/a&gt; every weekend and keep us stocked up on fire wood so we don’t freeze our buns off.  They&amp;#39;ve made sure that we know what a real pisco sour tastes like and how to make the simply delicious staple, Chilean salad.  They even threw Scott a birthday party complete with fresh ceviche and Chilean wine just a few days after we arrived!  They&amp;#39;ve played a huge role in the amazing experience we’ve had so far.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe that we’re already a month into this because in a lot of ways I feel like we&amp;#39;re just getting started.  There&amp;#39;s so much to do, so much to see and time seems to be racing past us - I wish I could hit the slowmo button and stretch out the time we have left, &lt;em&gt;just a little bit&lt;/em&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Lake Villarrica</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Villarrica&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south of Chile, in between two charming town, sits a lake with jaw-dropping views from every angle.  Jagged mountains serve as the primary backdrop to the typically glass-like water.  Though the towering volcano with smoke looming around its peak can easily steal the show with the overwhelming sense of awe it provokes.  This lake just so happens to be located two blocks from the cabin we’re currently calling home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Villarrica&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Villarrica&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Villarrica&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the lake remains fairly quiet during the colder months, the presently deserted kiosks, the empty black sand beach, and the single brave kayaker give us glimpses of the lively scenes that flood its shores in the summer.  While we dream of those warmer days when we can dip our feet into the pristine water, we will not let the chilly air keep us from enjoying walks along the shore, reveling in its staggering beauty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Villarrica&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Villarrica&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.05.14+Lake+Villarrica/Lake+Villarrica-12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something incredibly calming about the sight of water that seems to put everything into perspective and quiets the day-to-day anxieties that we all experience.  The massive mountains seem to tell us that our worries are not nearly as big as they feel, and encourage moments of reflection which help us re-evaluate our priorities. Though the busyness of our lives can often times discourage us from taking the time to partake in simple things that don’t produce a tangible product, such as taking a walk, I always feel more grounded after I have allowed myself to do those things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this and once again realize how fortunate we are to live so close to this little oasis in southern Chile, I hope to take advantage of all that this lake offers as much as possible during our time here.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Why I Travel</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;travel&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.15+Why+do+we+travel%3F/travel.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m naturally a pretty quiet person (though some might say otherwise).  I love going out and spending time with my friends, but I also love quiet time at home.  My entire life I’ve been labeled “the quiet one”.  When I was younger I frequently got asked, &lt;em&gt;“Do you speak?”&lt;/em&gt; by people I didn’t know well.  I started to really hate that about myself.  I felt like it was a hurdle I had to overcome if I ever wanted to be successful.  Then the summer before my senior year in college I decided to study abroad in Spain.  I intentionally did not go through my university; instead I went with an outside program where I wouldn’t know anyone.  In some ways it was a test.  &lt;em&gt;Can you do this?  What will you do when you have no one to hide behind?  How will you get by without your safety net of friends?&lt;/em&gt;  Needless to say, it was quite the shock at first.  But I adapted, and eventually it became a whole lot easier.  I passed the test.  I think I knew all along that I would, but I needed that extra push.  Without even realizing it in the moment, I was living out the mantra that I’ve been trying to live by recently - &lt;em&gt;If something scares you, do it&lt;/em&gt;.  The fear that comes from the unknown is something that I want to continue to confront, face on.  I’ve realized that I need that uncomfortableness in my life to challenge myself.  I need a little kick in the pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I travel more and more, certain places start to remind me of other places that I’ve been.  Sometimes it’s the streets or the style of the buildings, other times it’s the specific mix of restaurants and food, or the way that people act and other subtle cultural aspects.  When things start to blur together in my head I begin to question the point of traveling.  If so many of the things are similar, especially in this very globalized world that we live in today, then what’s the point?  Is it just for the fun of it - just for the sheer thrill of getting away?  Is it just to give us an excuse to indulge in wine at lunchtime without feeling guilty about it?  Or is it just to say &lt;em&gt;“I’ve been there - check!”&lt;/em&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, none of those reasons are bad reasons to travel.  And sometimes I do just want to get away and have a cocktail at noon.  But even when I lose sight of the reasons I travel, I know deep down that there’s a deeper purpose.  It’s not solely about the great food and spectacular sights (though they are most definitely perks).  For me, it’s about expanding my worldview by experiencing new things.  Being in a new place helps give me a fresh perspective on life.  It’s all the little things that add up and make me realize that there’s so much more to life.  There’s so much that I don’t know.  It’s in the awkward language exchanges, the daily, seemingly mundane customs, and the way that traveling forces you outside your comfort zone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how many places I go, there’s always more to see and learn, and that’s why I keep going.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What gives you that kick in the pants?&lt;/em&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>5 Things To Do in Buenos Aires</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.23+5+Things+to+do+in+Buenos+Aires/Buenos+Aires-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Buenos Aires is a huge city with so many things to do and see! It&amp;#39;s the wonderful mix of many different cultures that makes the city so interesting and unique.  We were only there long enough to barely scratch the surface, so I hope to go back one day and dig in a little deeper.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.23+5+Things+to+do+in+Buenos+Aires/Buenos+Aires-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.23+5+Things+to+do+in+Buenos+Aires/Buenos+Aires-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.23+5+Things+to+do+in+Buenos+Aires/Buenos+Aires-7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.23+5+Things+to+do+in+Buenos+Aires/Buenos+Aires-8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. PURUSE THE TRENDY SHOPS OF PALERMO&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Palermo neighborhood is a collection of trendy restaurants and boutique shops. It's a great place to grab a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; cup of coffee or stop for a bite to eat.  For all the coffee nerds (like us), check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/fullcitycoffeehouse/&quot;&gt;Full City Coffee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/FelixFelicisCoffee&quot;&gt;Félix Felices &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;. Then for lunch I recommend stopping for a burger at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BurgerJointPalermo&quot;&gt;The Burger Joint&lt;/a&gt;.  I normally don't order a burger when I'm out (espeically when I'm traveling), but these were well worth it.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2. TAKE A WALK AROUND LA BOCA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can't visit Buenos Aires without taking some time to walk around the Boca neighborhood, home to the famous Boca Juniors football team.  The area is filled with colorful buildings, street vendors, and kids playing football.  It can be pretty touristy in some parts, but I still think it's worth a walk through to get a glimpse of the unique culture.   
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3. TRY AN ASSORTMENT OF EMPANADAS AND WASH THEM DOWN WITH SOME MATE&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Empanadas are everywhere in BA.  It's hard not to buy one from every little bakery you pass.  They come in all different shapes, sizes, and flavors, so make sure to try a variety of them.  Most of them are savory, but if you love them that much you could have them as your main dish and dessert!  To accompany your afternoon snack, try some mate to share with friends.  Mate is a type of tea typically consummed at home, but you can find some restaurants that serve it as well. It's meant to be passed around and shared with friends.    
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4. CHEER ON ONE OF THE CITY’S TOP FOOTBALL TEAMS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One of the best experiences that we had in Buenos Aires was attending a football match.  I feel like it encapsulates so much of Argentinian culture.  To see the dedication and intensity of the fans cheering on their favorite team, is an unforgettable sight.  We went to see Racing Club vs. Boca Juniors with &lt;a href=&quot;http://landingpadba.com/&quot;&gt;Landing Pad&lt;/a&gt; tour company.  I highly recommended checking them out if you're interested in going to a football match.  The provide an amazing service complete with pre-game snacks and drinks, along with transport to and from the stadium.  You will not regret it. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5. EXPERIENCE THE CITY AFTER DARK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Buenos Aires really comes alive when the sun goes down.  Tons of people fill the streets, restaurants, bars, and clubs.  If you want to get a feel of daily life in BA, go to a late dinner then walk around and find a bar that the locals frequent.  Even better, start up a converstaion with someone at the bar and learn about the &lt;em&gt;porteño&lt;/em&gt; way of life.  Have them point you in the direction of a local tango club where you can witness (or participate in) a whole sub-culture of the city.   
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.23+5+Things+to+do+in+Buenos+Aires/Buenos+Aires-9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*BONUS CHALLENGE*&lt;/strong&gt;: SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT A DOG WALKER WITH MORE THAN 17 DOGS! 
&lt;br&gt;
Walking dogs could be an olympic sport in BA.  I have never seen so many people around the city walking more than 5 dogs at once.  I'm pretty sure that the most we saw was about 17 dogs at once, so I challenge you to top that!  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>An Ode to Summer</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Summer&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.06+An+Ode+to+Summer/Summer.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked right past each other.  I felt your lively presence whiz past me.  I caught a glimpse of you out of the corner of my eye.  &lt;em&gt;Why didn’t you stop and say hello, dear friend?&lt;/em&gt;  It’s been a while since we met.  We had a brief encounter last year, but it was not nearly long enough to really catch up.  &lt;em&gt;How have you been?  Do you still have that bright, enthusiastic smile?&lt;/em&gt;  I always loved that about you.  Always sparking joy where ever you go.  Everyone seems to light up when you&amp;#39;re around.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope we can meet again soon, though it will probably be longer that I wish.  You always seem to disappear for too long.  Sometimes it may seem like I’m pushing you away, it’s just that I need a break, but just a brief one.  After a while I start to wonder if I’ve hurt your feelings and you’ve left for good.  But just when I&amp;#39;ve almost given up hope, you come back.  You always come sneaking back, sometimes later than others.  Oh, what a joyous reunion it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we’ll have to be apart for longer than usual.  It’s not by choice, of course.  It’s just the way it has to be.  But don’t leave.  Please stay nearby, waiting for me, ready to greet me with open arms.  I’m going to need a big warm hug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

          <title>Leaving Room for the Unexpected</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking boots&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.03.30+Leaving+Room+for+the+Unexpected/feet.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
11:00  Visit museum&lt;br&gt;
12:30 Eat lunch in the park behind museum&lt;br&gt;
1:00  Relax in the park&lt;br&gt;
1:30  Eat ice cream
...
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve come a long way since my days of planning out every minute of our travels.  I think back on Scott&amp;#39;s and my first real trip together and can feel the gravity of the change.  We went to San Francisco and I had every day mapped out to a T.  There were times when we were forced to change our plans for one reason or another, but almost every second of our days were planned out in advance.  Scott &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; convinced me on our last day to wander around without any plans.  I was nervous, tense, confused.  &lt;em&gt;Well, then what are we going to do?&lt;/em&gt;, I thought.  But I gave in because, after all, it was his vacation too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was uneasy at first.  I didn’t understand the point.  We were going to miss something!  But after a while, I started to actually enjoy it.  We wandered to a new part of the city and had an amazing meal that I still have fond memories of today.  I slowly learned to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Leaving Room&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.03.30+Leaving+Room+for+the+Unexpected/leaving+room.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still a planner.  I love to make lists and check things off.  I thoroughly enjoy researching each place we visit before we go.  But I’ve learned to balance the planned while still leaving room for the unexpected, because it’s in those moments that lasting memories are made.  The times when I have let the motion of the place and the moment in time guide my experience, rather than a line in my planner, have largely been times of growth.  I think that these are the times that make traveling so transformative for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On New Year’s Eve 2014 we were in Kemi, Finland.  We were there with the sole intention of visiting Santa (&lt;em&gt;the real one&lt;/em&gt;) in Rovaniemi.  We had no expectations for Kemi.  We just happened to stay there because we booked our trip last minute and we couldn’t find any place to stay in Rovaniemi within our budget.  So it was 11:30 pm and we had just gotten off the train in Kemi.  As we walked back to our hotel, we were looking for a place to ring in the New Year.  The streets were dark, almost black, save for the blanket of snow on the ground.  As we turned the corner to our hotel we stumbled upon one of the only places that seemed to be inhabited.  The neon sign read “&lt;em&gt;The Old Gringo&lt;/em&gt;”.  Let me remind you, we are in rural Finland, almost as far north as the Arctic Circle, and here we are as Texans, standing in front of The Old Gringo.  The absurdity of it all was just too much.  Let’s just say it was fate.  That New Years will forever be ingrained in my memory - the fierceness of the hugs from happy strangers, and the numerous laughs we’ve had recounting the hilarity of that moment in time still do not escape me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to do this more often.  To remember the value in those moments.  And not just when I’m traveling, but in my daily life.  I want to leave room for the unexpected to happen when I’m at home, in my own city.  After all, where&amp;#39;s the fun in already knowing everything that’s going to happen?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

          <title>My Journey Learning Spanish</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am, less than three weeks till we move to Chile, a Spanish-speaking country, trying to get serious about studying Spanish again.  This is a cycle that I have come to know intimately.  It goes something like this - get motivated one way or another, make a plan, start studying, slowly lose momentum, then wake up one day and realize that I haven&amp;#39;t done anything in over a month.  After that comes the terrible guilt and questioning if I will ever be able to stick with it long enough to speak fluently.  Those feelings used to really get me down, and sometimes they still do, though lately when this happens I am learning to forgive myself for losing track of my goals and not harping on it - I just have to get back to work.  It’s not easy, it never is, but I know I have to keep moving forward.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.03.23+My+Journey+with+Spanish/Journey-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my primary reason for moving to Chile is to teach.  Though I’m also hoping, as a result of living in a Spanish-speaking country, I will be able to propel my Spanish skills far beyond what they are now.  I know from experience that it won’t work by osmosis (if only).  There will have to be a lot of effort put forth on my part if I’m going to make significant gains.  Part of the reason that I’m writing all this here is to keep myself accountable.  But the other reason is because I’ve been on this journey for a while (&lt;em&gt;actually, an embarrassingly long time&lt;/em&gt;) and it can be a lonely road sometimes.  It&amp;#39;s nice to hear that other people are trudging along the same rocky path, getting those annoying pebbles stuck in their shoes too.  &lt;em&gt;I feel ya.&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m in Chile I’ll be working with students and helping facilitate their journeys to learn English.  One of the reasons that I love doing that so much is that I can completely relate to them.  Our backgrounds and experiences are different, but I know what it feels like to be completely lost and not understand a word of what someone is saying.  I also know the indescribable delight that comes from communicating effectively (even in broken Spanish) with someone in another language.  My heart does not stop smiling for days.  I remember one of the first times that I felt that.  I was at the post office mailing a package, and as I started to leave I overheard the lady next to me having a really hard time communicating with the postal worker.  Before I could think too hard about it, I walked over and said &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;¿Necesitas ayuda?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.  She looked at me with desperation in her eyes and nodded her head.  I proceeded to attempt to interpret what she wanted to get across to the postal worker.  I was scrambling, piecing together the bits of language that I understood and trying to make some sense of them.  Looking back on it now, I don&amp;#39;t know how much help I really was.  I probably just confused things even more.  But she was so grateful.  And I walked away thinking I had done it.  I had communicated with someone in Spanish, in the real world.  It was exhilarating.  That was five years ago, and to this day I still get that same excitment when I get to use Spanish in the real world to communicate with real people.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s path to learning a language is unique, and admittedly this is my very personal one, but I’m putting it out there for whatever it’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;¡Vamos a aprender español!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And if you&amp;#39;re looking for a place to start, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Process of Pursuit&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.03.15+We%27re+Moving%2C+Again/Moving-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s happening again.  We’re gearing up to make a cross-continental move.  This time in the opposite direction - down to the southern hemisphere.  We will be settling in Chile where I will be teaching English in a Chilean public school.  There are still many unknowns, which can occasionally lead to uneasiness, but mostly we&amp;#39;re just really excited.  The plan is to be in Chile for about 8 months and get to know the country as best as we can while we&amp;#39;re there.  Before we get to Chile we&amp;#39;ll be making a week stopover in Buenos Aires to get a little taste of Argentina (think prime beef, wine and empanadas).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working through the pre-move checklist - visas, doctors, packing, and the like; and although it’s on our minds all the time, I still can’t believe it’s real.  About a year ago, when our time in Finland was winding down, in the midst of a daydream I blurted out, “What if we moved to South America for a while?”.  It was completely hypothetical and far-fetched, but then Scott responded with, “That’d be cool.”, and I started considering it.  Ultimately I decided that it would be pretty darn cool too (&lt;em&gt;shocker&lt;/em&gt;).  From that moment we continued to entertain the idea until it got to the point where we were talking financials and real life plans.  And then it was settled.  We decided we were going to make it happen, one way or another.  Now here we are, after a lot of planning and even more late-night conversations, our hands are shaking but we have big smiles on our faces. Adventure awaits.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our adventure starts on April 9, check back soon for an overload of pictures and stories or for regular upates follow along &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/meredithspetit/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Process of Pursuit&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.12.14+Living+in+the+process+of+pursuit/Process+of+pursuit-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read this quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://alisonsudol.com/&quot;&gt;Alison Sudol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegreatdiscontent.com/&quot;&gt;The Great Discontent&lt;/a&gt; recently, it really stuck with me.  Alison’s words gave life to the feeling I’ve been experiencing in this current stage of life.  Transitional, and questioning where exactly I’m headed.  I have a lot of ideas and dreams, but no clear path.  I’ve being trying out a lot of new things and discovering new interests.  Some of those things seem to have no (or very little) overlap, which makes it all confusing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been slowly sorting through these thoughts and carving out a path to follow, at least in the short term.  It’s scary because it’s so unknown.  &lt;em&gt;Is this how I’m supposed to start?  Are people going to think I’m crazy?  Will I come out of this thinking it was all worth it?  Or will it all blow up in my face?&lt;/em&gt;  These are the types of questions that nag at me on a regular basis.  Then I have to remind myself to just keep moving forward.  This life is a journey and I want to be an active participant in it.  I don’t know where it’ll lead me, but that’s part of the excitement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These next couple months we will be stepping into the unknown, not having a carefully laid plan.  On the days that we question our decisions and whether we are doing the right thing, I have to remind myself that it is a process.  We’re moving forward and pursuing our dreams and the rest will come on its own.  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Better Together: Coffee &amp; Cardamom</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Coffee and Cardamom&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.11+Better+together_Coffee+and+Cardamom/Better+together_Coffee+and+Cardamom.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Above left: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenkitchenstories.com/hazelnut-apple-chocolate-buns/&quot;&gt;Hazelnut-chocolate cardamom buns&lt;/a&gt; by Green Kitchen Stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weather gets cooler I start planning all the ways to stay cozy and warm at home.  One of my favorite ways to enjoy cold mornings is slowly lingering over coffee, preferably wrapped in a warm blanket.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get us excited about the dark, freezing mornings in Finland, we started dedicating Saturday mornings to making something special for breakfast (usually pancakes) and huddling around our tiny kitchen table with coffee.  We spent time talking about the week and planning out our day while the pancakes sizzled on the stove.  To switch it up we tried different varieties of pancakes.  There were blueberry pancakes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mynewroots.org/site/2012/01/gluten-free-banana-bread-pancakes-2/&quot;&gt;banana bread pancakes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/11/apple-pancakes/&quot;&gt;apple pancakes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenkitchenstories.com/coconut-quinoa-pancakes/&quot;&gt;coconut pancakes&lt;/a&gt;.  And then one morning there were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenkitchenstories.com/hazelnut-apple-chocolate-buns/&quot;&gt;cardamom buns&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I would not suggest these if you are just looking for a quick breakfast treat, but if you have some time to spare these buns will not let you down.  If you’ve never tried cardamom, well you need to.  So go pour yourself a cup of coffee and make these buns.  Then freeze half of them and pop one in the oven when you’re in need of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(culture)&quot;&gt;fika&lt;/a&gt;. You can thank me later.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Paris | A look back</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;A different side of Paris&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.10.20+Paris/Paris-29.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that experiences create lasting happiness, while the joy that comes with material things quickly fades.  Part of the joy that comes from experiences, even long after they are over, comes from the fact that we tend to look back on our experiences with rose-colored glasses.  We remember them better than they were in the moment.  When I first read about that I didn’t like the idea of it.  I wanted to remember my experiences how they were, not as a idealized version of them.  It really bothered me for a while, especially because I realize that I do it all the time.  One of the times that I realized I was doing that same thing was when I talked about the winters we spent in Finland.  I would describe the days riding our bikes from one place to another, in sub 0 temperatures, as no big deal, I’d just shrug it off.  Then I forced myself to recall my specific thoughts and feelings during a particular bike ride and I’d start to remember how miserable it was.  The ice cold wind cutting through my thick scarf and piercing my skin, straining to take a breath through the bone dry air, and peeling my frozen scarf from my hair once I was inside - I still can’t quite feel how that once felt, but I do know that I was not so thrilled about it at the time.  So why is that so hard for me recall?  Why isn’t that the first thing that comes to mind when I think back on that memory?  I don’t know why it’s like that, but I think that in some way my feelings are now connected to my experience as a whole in Finland, and not just that specific day.  In a way, I think less about how I felt during that particular experience and more about if it was worth it, if the whole thing was worth freezing for.  When I have some time and distance from experiences, even the less than ideal experiences (or even outright bad ones), they seem to have less impact.  In fact, they actually make the overall experience more memorable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;A different side of Paris&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.10.20+Paris/Paris-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve realized lately that I’ve been doing the same thing about the time we spent in Paris at the end of the summer.  All I think about now is how much I want to go back.  Paris is such a inspiring place.  Don’t get me wrong, we actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a great time and love the city, but I’d be lying if I said that we weren’t yearning to get back to Texas by that last week.  It was a combination of a bunch of different things, but we were struggling to enjoy every moment in city.  There was an internal push that got us out, walking around, exploring, when all we really wanted to do was get on a plane and go home.  At the time I felt like we were ungrateful for the time we got to spend in Paris, but we just couldn’t shake the feeling.  Talking to some friends who spent a lot of time traveling and who shared similar sentiments during moments of their travels, helped us to realize that that is often part of being on the go for long periods of time.  And it’s worth it.  Even though I know that it’s not as rosy as I remember it most of the time.  Even though I know that traveling comes with its own set of struggles and difficult moments, I never regret it.  In fact, I just crave it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These photos were taken the first ten days we spent in Paris, when my mom and aunt came to meet us, before we got into our slump.  I had so much fun taking them around to some of my favorite places and planning out our days, which mostly consisted of lots of walking, wine, and bread.  Exactly as one should experience Paris.                                &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m ready to go back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our short stay in the caves of Guadix, we spent a couple days in Granada.  It was really neat to see all the Arabic influences around the city, which made it so different than any other Spanish city we’d seen.  Of course we spent a big chunk of our time walking around the enormous Alhambra, and it was incredible.  I can see why people wouldn&amp;#39;t want to leave that place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way to Seville we took a pit stop in Jaén for some olive oil tasting.  The province of Jaén is a major producer of olive oil in Spain with olive groves covering just about everywhere you look.  We were the only people at this small, &lt;a href=&quot;http://oleicolasanfrancisco.com/&quot;&gt;family-owned olive mill&lt;/a&gt; which meant we got to ask all the questions we ever wanted about olive oil.  Our excellent tour guide talked us through the process of producing olive oil and then we got to taste three that they had produced (one of which was awarded #2 in the world in 2014).    We convinced ourselves that it was necessary to buy an abundance of olive oil and were banking on sheer magic that it would all fit in our luggage.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our very last stop in Spain was Seville.  We had heard such great things about the city and were pumped to explore this part of Andalusia.  Unfortunately, we happened to be there during some really high temperature days which made a lot of outdoor activities almost unbearable.  But we made up for the heat with tapas and sangria galore!  You can never go wrong with more sangria.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Spain Road trip | Altea, Mojacar, and Guadix</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Spain road trip&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.08.30+Spain+Road+Trip/southern+spain+road+trip_title.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last week in Spain we rented a car and spent a week driving from Valencia to Seville.  Our plan was to not have a plan.  Or at least a very loose one.  We left on Tuesday and had to get to Seville by the next Tuesday, and that was about it.  After being carless for the greater part of two years we were really looking forward to the freedom that a car would allow us.  We could go anywhere we wanted, whenever we wanted, all without buying tickets!  We didn’t even have to pack our suitcases so meticulously because, hey, &lt;em&gt;just throw it in the trunk&lt;/em&gt;!  The joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Spain road trip&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.08.30+Spain+Road+Trip/southern+spain+road+trip-30.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place we stopped was Altea.  It’s a small town less than two hours south of Valencia on the coast.  We stayed just long enough to down a pitcher of sangria, sweat profusely walking up a never ending incline to our hostel, enjoy mojitos and a sunset on the beach, and skid both of my knees on the street (they should really have signs warning against carrying overweight backpacks while walking down steep streets).  All of which took less than 24 hours, in case you’re wondering.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove to Mojacar, another small coastal town.  It’s really a neat town with great views, but we got there right during siesta time which meant there wasn’t a lot going on.  So we ate another great meal (plus more sangria) and then wandered around a bit before hitting the road again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I said we didn’t have a plan, I meant that nothing was set in stone, but I would be lying (and not fooling anyone) if I said that I didn’t research places along our route and have an idea of places we wanted to see.  One of the places that did not make the list, because of time constraints, was Guadix.  It was going to be a little out of the way and we just thought it would be rushing too much to try and make it there.  But when we decided to leave Mojacar early we figured that we could make time for an overnight stop in Guadix, and I was stoked.  Ever since I had read about the people in Guadix that lived in caves, I wanted to visit one.  Well we ended up booking this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3323543&quot;&gt;great cave&lt;/a&gt; at the last minute so we could experience life as cave-dwellers for a night.  It was such a fun and unique experience.  What started out as a place to skip over, turned out to be one of the most memorable stops on our trip.  Life with a car, I’m telling you.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Valencia</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting here in an apartment in Paris, staring out the window, thinking back on last month when we were in Spain. Wasn’t it just yesterday that we found out that we’d be in Paris for most of July, and then decided on a whim to spend five weeks in Spain? What an unexpected and exciting surprise that was. Now we’re on the last stretch of our trip with only 8 days left. Although we love Paris, we’re also really looking forward to being back in Texas (minus the heat) and settling down for a while.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we decided to go to Spain for the month of June we also decided to rent an apartment for the entire month so we’d have a home base.  There’s so many great cities in Spain so it was not an easy feat to choose just one, but ultimately we settled on Valencia.  And it turned out to be a great choice.  Up until the last week, the weather was just perrrrrfect.  The kind of weather that forces me to &lt;em&gt;ohhh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ahhh&lt;/em&gt; over it every time I step outside, which is Scott’s absolute favorite part about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.07.05+Valencia/Valencia-11.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that last brutally hot week was the one that we chose to ride bikes to the beach. It was going to be the best way to spend our last weekend in Valencia. I was convinced and had it all planned out.  We’d rent bikes in the morning, ride to the nicer, less crowded beach, eat paella on the beach, maybe go on a boat ride, walk around the town, then head back in the evening when it got a little cooler.  It was a solid plan.  So we got our bikes that morning and began our ride through the park.  Everything going just as planned.  We stopped to check directions, took off our helmets to get some air flow, and casually commented that it was a little warm-ish.  Still playing it cool though.  We&amp;#39;re from Texas after all, we can handle a little heat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, um, I don’t know exactly how far it is, but that one website said you could ride there so I’m sure we’ll be there soon!&lt;/em&gt;, I told Scott.  &lt;em&gt;But I mean, this is fun, right? Look how pretty it is! Oh look, there’s a sign, just 5 km to go.&lt;/em&gt;  We’re having a good time, we’re optimistic, the wind is blowing in our faces, then we stopped.  Sweat everywhere, soaking everything.  &lt;em&gt;Wait. Why does it say 10 km now?&lt;/em&gt; The bike path ended and we were debating our next move. We had already ridden farther than we expected and it was most definitely much hotter than we expected.  &lt;em&gt;I am so hot. No, you don’t understand, I am really REALLY hot!  Yes, I see your sweat soaked shirt, but there&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;re hotter than me right now.&lt;/em&gt; I couldn’t pretend I was having fun anymore.  I was hungry and hot. We both were.  So we scratched our original plans, turned around and went back to the beach we had just past.  Funny thing is, laying out on the beach was not part of the plan, so neither of us had our swimsuits.  Luckily, I had a stroke of genius before we left and stuffed a sports bra into the backpack, just in case.  I changed into my sudo swim top (poor white shirt will never be the same) as fast as humanly possible and made a beeline to the ocean.  We decided that the only reason that we would be leaving the beach for the rest of the day would be to eat, that’s it.  And even though we didn’t end up following any of the plans I had so carefully laid out, it was a good day.  I even have a sick shorts tan to show for it.                   &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The medieval village of Albarracín</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.06.29+Albarrac%C3%ADn/Albarracin+title+2.jpg&quot;width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;When I did my research on the day and weekend trips we should take from Valencia, Albarracín was not one of the places that I came across. Though luckily we got the inside scoop from someone who&amp;#39;s been living in Spain for a long time, and I&amp;#39;m so glad we did.  This place was truly unique, it makes you feel like you&amp;#39;ve stepped right back into the Middle Ages.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village is situated in a valley which is completely surrounded by the Sierra de Albarracín mountains. The old town is built up vertically with a castle at the very top.  A wall was built (and most of it still remains) around 3 quarters of the old town to protect the village. The village has been kept in such good conditions that you can really begin to imagine what it would have been like during the medieval times. Our stay in Albarracín was pretty short, so we spent most of our time wandering around the steep, and narrow streets in the old town. There&amp;#39;s plently of historical spots to check out, tons of great views to take in, and cafés to stop in to give your feet a break.  If you don&amp;#39;t mind doing a good amount of walking (with a lot of it being uphill), then I would highly recommended spending some time here.  It felt so different than anywhere else I&amp;#39;ve been in Spain, plus you pretty much escape the big tourist crowds. Two thumbs up in my book!     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Our first morning there, we got up just before sunrise to hike up to the wall that surrounds the old town.  When our alarms went off there was serious talk about pulling the covers back over our heads, but after much deliberation we finally managed to drag ourselves out of bed. The morning chill was much colder than either of us had imagined (or packed for), which made the getting up part that much harder. I wore Scott&amp;#39;s only long-sleeve button down over my tank top, while he braved it in a t-shirt. To get to the wall we walked all the way up through the old town and then the rest of the way up the side of the mountain.  There was not another soul to be seen. It was as if the entire village had evacuated over night and no one had bothered to tell us. But really I didn&amp;#39;t mind. It was a pretty cool (and cold) feeling to sit on top of the wall, looking down at an empty town, as the sun began to peak over the mountain tops.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our first half day there we had seen most of the things that we wanted to see in the old town, so we walked along the Guadalaviar River which runs around the village. It was a nice, peaceful escape from the harsh mid-day sun. We spent a day and a half in Albarracín in all and thought it was the perfect amount of time to see it all and relax a little. Oh, and in case you really ARE planning a trip to Albarracín, we stayed in this great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacasagrandedealbarracin.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=category&amp;amp;layout=blog&amp;amp;id=15&amp;amp;Itemid=2&amp;amp;lang=es&quot;&gt;bed and breakfast&lt;/a&gt; which made our trip that much better.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re still in Valencia for another week, but I thought I would go ahead and share some photos from our day trip to the coastal town of Peñíscola.  Let me first say that the day started off not quite the way we had hoped.  As we pulled up to the old town the rain was coming down harder and harder, and it didn&amp;#39;t look like it was going to let up any time soon.  Now, we should be used to this kind of weather from our two years in Finland, but we have been completely spoiled by the sunny days in Valencia that even a couple clouds are an unwelcomed surprise.  I was convinced that the day was going to be spent in cafés, hiding from the downpour.  Usu ally that wouldn&amp;#39;t be the worst thing, but in this case that would mean missing out on some incredible views.  Fortunately, a couple of hours later the sun started to make its way out from behind the clouds, the fog cleared, and we were back in business.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Peñíscola comes from the Latin word for peninsula, and it is about an hour and a half train ride north from Valencia.  At the highest point of the peninsula sits a castle named for the antipope Benedict XIII, or Papa Luna, as referred to in Spanish. When Papa Luna was excommunicated from the Catholic Church, he fled to Peñíscola were he lived out the rest of his life.  Now in the castle and throughout the town, you can see depictions of &lt;em&gt;lunas&lt;/em&gt; or moons which represent the antipope.        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old town is filled with narrow streets lined with white-washed buildings, decorated with greenery and flowers.  It is evident that most of the town had been developed and targeted for tourists, but around every corner you can find a new place to stop and enjoy the postcard-worthy views. There&amp;#39;s most definitely a reason that this is a popular Spanish destination.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent our last weekend in Finland checking out some new places, and revisiting some of our favorites in Helsinki. One of my favorites being Suomenlinna.  Scott hadn&amp;#39;t been able to visit the island yet and our last day in Finland proved to be the perfect time to remedy that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did nothing more than pack a picnic lunch and enjoy the sunny (yet still a little chilly) day. That night we ate at the most delicous &lt;a href=&quot;http://spis.fi/&quot;&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate our two years in Finland.  It may have been the best meal I&amp;#39;ve ever eaten. So although we were sad to leave, we left on a pretty great note.       &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Saying Goodbye</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we say goodbye to Joensuu.  There are so many emotions that have come with the end of our time here.  We’re excited to start our next adventure, but sad to leave this place because of all the ways it’s changed us, because of all the friends we’ve made, and the experiences that we’ll cherish forever.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we were talking about our favorite things that we’ve done since we moved here.  We’ve been incredibly fortunate to experience some amazing things, things that I never dreamed of doing - dog sledding in Finnish Lapland, ice swimming in a lake, watching the Northern Lights from our balcony, and so many other unforgettable experiences.  But I think what’s made the biggest impact of all has been all the little things added up over the years.  We made close friends from around the world and we just lived our day-to-day lives in Finland.  It’s still     unbelievable to me sometimes that we made this move.  It hasn’t always been easy (lest we forget sleeping on the floor, resident permits, dragging our suitcases through ice, and 9 months of winter), but it’s all been worth it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine my life without this piece of the puzzle.  Years before we came here I longed to live abroad, but I had no idea the impact it would have on me.  I now know and I crave it even more.  The world may not have much to say about this Nordic country, but it’s carved out a very special, reindeer-size place in our hearts.  Thank you, Finland, for opening our eyes and hearts to what we never knew we needed and now couldn’t live without. &lt;em&gt;Kiitoksia!&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been heads-down working to finish up school and prepare for our move at the end of the month, but here are some photos from the Vappu (May Day) celebrations last weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A tour of Rantakyla</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.14+Tour+of+Rantakyla/tour+of+rantakyla-5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our time in Finland is sadly coming to an end, quicker than I care to admit.  I find myself getting sentimental while I’m doing the most mundane things.  Thinking of everything that I’m going to miss about this place has really made me pay attention to the little things.  So today I’m going to give you a glimpse of one of the things that we have grown to love throughout our time here - our neighborhood.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.14+Tour+of+Rantakyla/tour+of+rantakyla-9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.14+Tour+of+Rantakyla/tour+of+rantakyla-6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size:90%&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt; beach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.14+Tour+of+Rantakyla/tour+of+rantakyla_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a neighborhood called Rantakyla, about 5 km from the center of Joensuu.  It only takes us about twenty minutes to bike to the city center, but somehow it feels like a world away.  If you drive through Rantakyla, you probably wouldn’t give it a second thought (or really even a first).  There’s not much here.  We’ve got the essentials, but nothing crazy like a &lt;em&gt;restaurant&lt;/em&gt; or anything.  (Full disclosure: There is a take-away pizza place that we discovered recently and have taken advantage of twice.  It comes in handy when you, &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt;, melt a plastic bowl in the oven.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.14+Tour+of+Rantakyla/tour+of+rantakyla-12.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After living here for almost two years, this little neighborhood of ours has become a special part of our lives.  All its little intricacies have made it endearing in a way.  There’s our friendly neighborhood S Market cashiers (who we visit on a daily basis), the sweet old lady at the pharmacy, and the late night karaoke enthusiasts.  Then there&amp;#39;s our secret beach (which turned out to be not so secret after all), where you can picnic during the summer and walk on the frozen lake in the winter.  And the horse barn just down the road.  We have tennis courts that turn into ice skating and hockey rinks in the winter, and you&amp;#39;ll always find someone out there playing as long as the lights are on.  When you need to get out of the house, you can always find a new path to take through the woods.  There&amp;#39;s a whole little world here, just waiting to be discovered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little neighborhood is where Scott and I lived together for the first time.  It&amp;#39;s where we spent our first Christmas away from our families.  It&amp;#39;s where we saw a spectacular dance of the Northern Lights.  And it&amp;#39;s the home we have come back to over the last two years.  Rantakyla may not be the most exciting place in Finland, but it will forever have a special place in our hearts.       &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The many faces of Spring</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.07+Spring+in+Finland/Spring+in+Finland-25.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun is out, plants are starting to bud, green is showing, water is dripping from the rooftops, and then BAM!, it’s snowing.  It’s not just a couple flakes here and there, it’s a full on downpour that lasts for days.  You got me again, Spring.  I fall for your antics every time.  &lt;em&gt;April fools? No?&lt;/em&gt;  You’re right, I should know you better than that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.07+Spring+in+Finland/Spring+in+Finland-20.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a really evil trick, but it happens over and over again.  When we got back from Lapland, there were clear skies and rising temperatures all week.  So I decided to put winter behind me.  I had my fun with the snow, but it was time for a change.  Time to welcome a new season, or so I thought.  Since that week we’ve had grey skies and snow or rain or both almost everyday.  I love Finland, really I do.  But I can’t say that I’ve been too happy with it these past couple weeks.  One day on my ride home from school, I yelled at the wind.  Yep, that’s right.  It was making my bike ride so miserable, that I finally gave it a piece of my mind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t be too careful walking around this time of year.  You never know if that ice you’re walking over will hold, or if it will give way to an ankle-deep puddle of water.  It’s as if everywhere you go, nature is playing a big trick on you…that lasts for a month.  Like when your brother takes your car keys, and hides in the closet, right before you need to leave.  It’s a little funny the first time (&lt;em&gt;ok, not really&lt;/em&gt;), but then the second and third time, the cuteness factor has really worn off, completely (hypothetically speaking).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to be a good sport.  I’m looking for the positive in all this.  But it’s a two way street, Finland.  You’ve got to give me something to work with.  I’m doing my part, now the ball’s in your court.    &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Magic of Lapland</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.23+The+Magic+of+Lapland/northern+lights-10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gone back and forth about the title of this post.  &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt; just sounds so cheesy.  I&amp;#39;m the one that scoffs at cheese balls and all their &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;.  But I&amp;#39;ve decided to stick with it, because that&amp;#39;s the only way that I can describe it adequately. This so-called magic is something difficult to put into words.  You just have to experience it for yourself.  It has something to do with being so far away from other people and so close to nature.  One Finn told us that when foreigners visit Finland, and stay in her cottage out in the middle of the forest, far removed from civilization, they start getting uncomfortable.  Often times they find the solitude of the forest too much and long to be close to people, stores and other conveniences again.  But she said, “that’s where us Finns feel most at home, in the middle of the forest, with no one else around.”  It can be strange if you’re not used to that feeling, especially for a prolonged period of time, but I think I’m starting to get it.  There is something pretty cool about being engulfed by trees that tower over you, on all sides, and slowing down enough to appreciate nature in all seasons (yes, even you, bitterly cold winter).

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Levi is pretty far north, it’s still a decent size town (you know, for being above the Arctic Circle). But our cottage was on the side of the mountain that is much less populated, so it felt pretty isolated.  There were no street lights on our street, so when we pulled up at 9pm the car lights were the only way we could see where we were going.  Just perfect for Northern Lights watching.  Several times a night, one of us would step out on the porch to check the sky and report back.  During our week stay, we were lucky enough to see them twice (three times, if you count the drive there).  That in itself is pretty magical.  The second night that we saw them, we stayed outside watching and taking pictures for probably two hours.  They were faint, then bright, then waves, then swirls, changing rapidly right before our eyes.  Mind-blowing.  Even though we were all pretty frozen after 2 hours, I stayed outside for 20 minutes after everyone decided to go in.  They started changing colors and I just couldn’t take my eyes away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the animals of Lapland.  The huskies, the wolves, the arctic foxes (!) and the reindeer.  The really make the whole experience so much better.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I&amp;#39;ve come to realize, while living in Finland, is the sincere appreciation and respect Finns have for nature.  It&amp;#39;s apparent in so many aspects of life, but it becomes especially clear in Lapland.  It&amp;#39;s just a special place that keeps calling you back.  Hopefully someday we&amp;#39;ll get to experience it all again.      &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Levi | Lapland, Finland</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s another thing you need to know about this mountain (fell) named Levi.  It’s also the name of the town.  But &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; it’s not.  It&amp;#39;s so confusing.  It’s actually Kittilä, which is the region or something, but everyone just calls it Levi.  I was super confused too the first time I typed “Levi, Finland” into Google Maps and nothing came up.  But everyone in Finland knows exactly what you’re talking about when you say you&amp;#39;re going to Levi.  So now that’s all cleared up, let’s talk about all the fun we had there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi/reindeer_skull.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;Where do I begin?  The weather?  Yes.  Mother Nature really cooked up a spectacular weather week for us.  The first couple days when the sun really shows up again, after the long winter months in Finland, feel like the best days of your life.  I always forget how wonderful the sun is.  And it is, really extra wonderful.  So every morning as we sat around the table eating breakfast and looking out the window, someone always said, “&lt;em&gt;Wow, we really have been so lucky with this weather&lt;/em&gt;.”  (In Finland you’re always surprised when it’s sunny for more than one day in a row).      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Lapland is all the animals that live there.  I would travel there just to see the reindeer and the huskies.  I love them that much.  But more on them later because right now I’ve got to tell you about the snowmobiles.  Snowmobiling has been on my list of things to do in Finland for a while.  The last full day we were in Levi we took some out for a two hour spin in celebration of our friend and travel partner’s birthday.  The day before, our friends had told us a horror story about two girls that had driven straight into a tree.  So I was a tad anxious.  Turns out I was a natural.  Well, maybe not a natural per se, but I did it and didn’t run into anyone or anything.  And it was so fun!  We drove around a big loop through the forest and over the frozen lake, making a couple stops to enjoy the scenery.  I think Scott’s favorite part was his helmet.  I have to admit, he kind of looked like a bad a**.  I was only slightly jealous.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way back to the cabin we stopped at this reindeer farm.  We watched while a man, dressed in traditional Sami costume, fed the reindeer and then we cooed over the cute little reindeer for a good while.  I’ll never get tired of them.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next up: The magic of Lapland&lt;/em&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Levi mountain</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pictures are from our first trip up the mountain.  Ok, it’s technically a fell, but that’s a mountain by Finnish standards.  So we’re going to call it a mountain.  Anyway, we drove nearly to the top to take in the view and check out the slopes one afternoon.  As soon as we opened the car doors we were blasted with some seriously cold and incredibly strong wind.  The wind was blowing so hard that the packed snow was wildly swirling through the air pummeling anything and everything around it.  There was a café not too far away from where we parked, so we all turned around, backs facing the flying snow, and walked backwards all the way there.  You could barely see anything but a cloud of white.  Our initial intention was just to hang out outside for a while looking out over the town, but the wind was so unbelievably crazy that we cut our viewing time short.  We only went into the café to rest for minute and thaw our frozen hands (from taking pictures) before walking right back through the storm.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was worth it, don’t you think? I’ll take a good beating from the wind for that kind of view any day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day that we went skiing on the mountain I met that ruthless wind again.  It was on our last run, just when the sun was setting.  Everything was so stinking beautiful.  But the wind was blowing harder than ever.  I couldn’t help but make a couple of pit stops for photo opts even though my hands suffered more and more each time.  By the time we made it down the mountain we were all out of breath and frozen.  But it was such a perfect ending.  Exhausted and in awe of it all.  That’s pretty much how I felt everyday of this trip.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next up: More on what we did in Levi.&lt;/em&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Lapland | The road trip</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.17+Lapland+road+trip/lapland+road+trip-10.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick double check that we packed everything - gloves, sweat pants and snacks (ya know, the essentials) - and we were out the door.  With the addition of our bags, we filled the car to the brim (Scott cleverly using plastic grocery bags for maximum squish-ability).  It was 6:30 am and we had almost 14 hours ahead of us before we would get to our cottage in Levi.  I was lucky enough to sit in the most coveted seat in the car, &lt;em&gt;back middle&lt;/em&gt;, where any move you make you’re almost guarenteed to be touching someone else around you.  But I did have a straight shot of the open road, so there’s that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.17+Lapland+road+trip/bridge_waterfall.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.17+Lapland+road+trip/group_waterfall.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our two drivers were experienced road trippers so they had planned out several stops along the way to break up the drive a little.  About three hours in we stopped to check out an ice waterfall just off the road.  From the car, we walked through the forest about 1 km to the waterfall. The recent rise in temperature had thawed out the ice just enough so there was actual water flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was Santa’s village.  How can you drive through the village and NOT stop to hang with Santa?  It was the end of his work day so we caught him with a remarkably short line.  Chatting with St. Nick for a couple of minutes gave us just enough energy to push through the last leg of the drive.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire trip we had our eyes peeled for roaming reindeer, but none were to be seen.  Then in the last two hours, while we were trying to entertain ourselves with an exceptionally long game of Celebrity, we caught a glimpse of one dashing out of the woods.  Not long after that, as we were driving down a dark road, we spotted the Northern Lights out the window!  Of course we had to pull over to marvel at them for a while and talk about how awesome it all was.  Someone even joked that we had basically seen it all so we could just turn around and go back home.  But after 12 hours of being in the car, that wasn’t something to joke about.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next up: Levi mountain.&lt;/em&gt;            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a little afraid to say this out loud, but &lt;em&gt;I’m not totally over winter yet.&lt;/em&gt;  I’m still into this whole thick sweater, steaming hot chocolate and hearty stew weather.  The winter has been good to us.  It’s given us lots of good snow and even some sunny days too!  Those days are the best.  Puts a smile on my face just thinking about them.  Except they can really fool a sun-deprived soul.  Over the weekend we had a super bright sunny day so I convinced Scott to go on a walk.  It wasn’t long after we started walking that we were reminded sun is not synonymous with warmth, not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been trying to experience this winter like true Finns, getting out there and embracing  the white world.  That’s how you’ve got to do it.  You have to crave that sharp bite of frozen air on your face and relish in the numbness of your fingers.  I’m not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; there yet, but I’m working on it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re just cross country skiing (way harder than it looks), ice swimming (just as cold as it looks), snowshoeing (right past bear tracks), and sledding (alongside all the small children).  It’s the best.  Yesterday we even tried curling!  That’s not so much a &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; winter activity, but it involves ice.  And where there’s ice there is falling and knee bruises.  Winter is not for wimps.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note, I’m going to go crawl back under the covers with my cup of coffee and experience some more winter.         &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Tulum, Mexico</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.19+Tulum%2C+Mexico/sunny+beach.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been tossing around the idea of a beach vacation for a little while, so when we stumbled upon Tulum we were sold.  It was going to be hard to live up to our expectations because we had hyped it up so much, but it did not disappoint.  Not in the least.  In fact, I think it was even better than we imagined.  Tulum used to be a fairly tourist-free corner of Mexico, but in recent years its secret has been plastered all over the internet.  Normally, that would mean it&amp;#39;s now overrun with giant resorts, chain restaurants and souvenir shops.  Although I don’t really know what it was like before, I’d say that it has blown up in the best way possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we turned onto the street parallel to the beach (the one with all the hotels), we immediately fell in love with this little jungle paradise.  You won’t find any big resorts on the beach, like you’ll see in Cancun and Playa del Carmen, instead it’s lined with small boutique-like hotels.  Our hotel had eight rooms, and five of them were huts disconnected from the main building.  It was a dream.  We spent our days laying on the beach, stuffing ourselves with the most delicious Mexican food (can you ever have too much?) and exploring the town.  Take me back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most memorable part of the trip was the night that we spent eating dinner at a fancy little restaurant on the beach.  They don’t have lights on the beach at night, so Scott and I were eating our meal looking out at the dark beach.  Not long after we started eating we saw several people walking down the beach with red laser-type lights.  We didn’t think much of it at first, but when we started to see more people using their lights to look in the bushes near the restaurant, we began to get curious.  We finally asked our waiter what they were all doing and he told us that they were looking for &lt;em&gt;
tortuguitas&lt;/em&gt; (baby turtles).  I freaked.  I had been talking about seeing a baby sea turtle months before our trip, but I didn’t think it was going to happen.  Apparently, when the turtles hatch they can’t see very well so they just move towards the light.  In a completely natural environment the moon reflecting off the water is the brightest light, so they instinctively go in that direction.  On beaches where there are hotels and other unnatural light sources, the turtles get confused by all the bright lights.  So these people were attempting to find the turtles and lead them to the ocean with their red light.  I didn’t want to disrupt the search, but I was itching to see one.  So as soon as I heard a couple yelling that they had found one, I abandoned my food at the table and sprinted down the beach, on my tippy toes, as to not step on one.  I am not kidding when I say that it was one of the cutest and most amazing things I’ve seen.  This tiny little turtle, moving ever so slowly, to the vast ocean for its first time.  Then I went back to a mouthwatering dinner, and rehashed how amazing it was.  &lt;em&gt;For the rest of dinner.&lt;/em&gt;  Best night.                         &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Russia Travel Tips</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.17+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia/church+ceiling.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, and especially St. Petersburg, is full of exciting cultural experiences waiting to be discovered.  In St. Petersburg it seems like around every corner there is something new to see or do.  Although we were there for three weeks, I feel like we barely scratched the surface of what the city has to offer and I’d love to go back someday.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.17+St.+Petersburg%2C+Russia/Winter+Palace.jpg&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.21+Russia+Travel+Tips/fall+bridge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Palavani&lt;/u&gt;: This place is a Georgian restaurant and wine bar with deeeeelicious food.  I honestly still dream about it.  If you go you have to get the khachapuri, oven baked bread stuffed with cheese.  It’s to die for.  The rest of the food is equally delicious and so are the Georgian wines.  We tried to go back for a second time on our last night and it was closed for a private event.  I don’t know if I’ve ever been so disappointed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stolle&lt;/u&gt;: We ate here for lunch one day after we went to the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood.  It’s just a short walk away and it’s a good, budget friendly café. They serve different types of Russian pies, both sweet and savory (we got both).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rada-k&lt;/u&gt;: This vegetarian buffet was just a block over from our flat so it was a perfect spot for a quick and easy lunch, that also happened to be darn good food.  Also, very good price for a good amount of food.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must make sure to try the famous Russian blinis at one of the many shops around town - they are everywhere, you can’t miss them! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After a frantic scramble to find a place to stay (after we were already in St. Petersburg) with a kitchen and internet, we ended up with this great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1544891&quot;&gt;airbnb flat&lt;/a&gt;.  If you need something for a longer stay, like we did, or you like to have a kitchen to cook in, this is a great option.  It was spacious flat with all the amenities and close to the center of the city, which was exactly what we needed.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.01.21+Russia+Travel+Tips/fall+in+Pushkin.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPLORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hermitage Museum&lt;/u&gt;: A must see when in St. Petersburg.  It’s one of the oldest and largest art museums in the world; you could spend weeks in there and not see everything.  Not only is there exquisite art in the museum, the rooms themselves are works of art.  Everything is so ornate you will be left in awe.  Entrance is free for students and children and free for everyone the first Thursday of every month.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre&lt;/u&gt;:  One of the things on my must-do list, while in Russia, was to see a ballet.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mariinsky.ru/en/&quot;&gt;Mariinsky Theatre&lt;/a&gt; is the most famous historic theatre in St. Petersburg, which holds ballets, operas and orchestra performances today.  We saw the Shurale ballet while we were visiting and it’s was absolutely amazing.  The theatre is gorgeous, I felt like I had stepped back in time.  If you can afford it, I’d suggest sitting in the first row of the dress circle right next to the Czar’s box.  You will have a great view of everything and will not be disappointed!     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood&lt;/u&gt;:  The first night we arrived in St. Petersburg, another student took us on a walk around the center of town.  It was already dark and we had no idea where we were going so when we turned the corner down one street and looked up to see this magnificent church that we had seen so many pictures of, we were stunned.  Obviously, it’s much better to see it during the day time when you can really take in all the bright colors and get the full effect of its fairly tale-like nature.  The inside is just as amazing, if not more, than the outside.  It’s covered, wall to wall, with mosaics.  If you have time, I’d recommended taking a peek inside.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer Garden&lt;/u&gt;: This garden is just a short walk from the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood.  It’s worth taking at least a short stroll through to see all the marble statues.  If the weather is nice, it would be a great place to stay and relax for a bit outside.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;St. Issac’s Cathedral&lt;/u&gt;: Another magnificent cathedral that’s just as breathtaking outside as it is in.  If you’d like, you can also climb to the top for a panoramic view of St. Petersburg! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Peter and Paul Fortress&lt;/u&gt;: Peter the Great established this fortress to protect the capital city from Swedish attach during the Northern War.  Lots to see around the area!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pushkin&lt;/u&gt;: We took a day trip to Pushkin and it was perfect - it’s definitely worth a trip.  If you want to go into all of the palaces and churches, you’ll probably want to get there early morning so you can do it all.  To get there from St. Petersburg you can take the purple metro line (line 5) to the Pushkinkaya stop.  From there you will walk about 5 minutes to get to the Tsarskoye Selo Railway.  The train costs about 40 rubles round trip, from St. Petersburg to Pushkin.  A bonus is you’ll get to ride in the oldest public railway in Russia.  The railway station itself is a site to see.  If you’re wanting to just stroll around the town, like we did, you don’t need to worry about leaving so early in the morning because after 6:00 pm Catherine’s Park has free entrance.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for something to take home with you, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://souvenirboutique.com/&quot;&gt;Souvenir Boutique&lt;/a&gt; has lots of good quality options.  There are other souvenir shops all of over town, seriously everywhere, but I thought that this one seemed to be much better quality, since most of the items are handmade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushkin, what a enchanting little town.  It is named after one of Russia’s most famous poets, Alexander Pushkin, who spent many years studying there.  The town itself is full of history, palaces and parks.  We took a day trip from St. Petersburg on the oldest railway in Russia and spent our time wandering around, admiring the colors and grand buildings, on the most perfect fall day.  As we were strolling around one of the parks, we started to notice everyone carrying around bunches of leaves.  Soon we saw that they were using them to make autumn leaf crowns to celebrate the season.  It’s not a holiday or a formal celebration, just a fun activity that people like to do during this time of year.  One nice woman made our day by letting us try on her crown for just a minute!  It’s the little things in life.  And I&amp;#39;m easily amused.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our trip to St. Petersburg came about through my teaching practice.  Our partner university is in Russia, so the program was designed so that our second practice would take place there.  I found out about this trip at our first program meeting when we got to Finland.  It had been a crazy, whirlwind of a week trying to get settled in a new country so I was a little taken aback when I heard about it (and not in a good way).  I wasn’t even used to this whole idea that I was going to be living in Finland for the next two years and &lt;em&gt;you’re sending me to Russia??&lt;/em&gt;  Needless to say, it was just my overwhelmed, irrational self that freaked out a bit in that moment and I soon built up lots of excitement about the trip.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a planner at heart.  I love looking forward and making plans about what we’re going to do, where we’re going to go and how we’re going to do it.  Checking things off my to-do lists - yep, it’s the best.  I realize that sometimes I do this to a fault and this was one of those times that I was forced to learn that lesson the hard way.  I was ready to start checking things off my list in January (and we weren’t going until October), but some of the other people, the ones that could make things happen, did not seem to share my urgency.  In fact, they had quite the opposite plans.  They were going to wait until the very last minute to issue all the paperwork so we could apply for our visas.  &lt;em&gt;It stresses me out just thinking about it again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there we were, a little over a month away from our trip, applying for our visas in Helsinki.  And we were prepared.  From previous experience with visa applications we knew that we needed to double and triple check all the required documents so that everything would go smoothly, and we did.  We’re standing there, in the application office, in front of the woman carefully checking all of our stuff, holding our breath.  Then it came - &lt;em&gt;ok, everything is ready, your visas will be sent to you be next week.&lt;/em&gt;  What WHAT!!  We left the office, fist pumping the air and high fiving like we had just won the lottery.  &lt;em&gt;We did it, we’re going to Russia!!&lt;/em&gt; Then reality quickly set in and I realized that we had left our passports in the office.  So we casually knocked on the door and informed the lady that we had accidentally left our passports with her.  &lt;em&gt;Yes, and I will send them back to your next week.&lt;/em&gt;  Hm.  Now that’s going to be a problem.  You see, we are leaving tomorrow on a little trip to Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England and Ireland…and I think they’re going to want us to have our passports.  And just like that we were walking out, with all of our documents in hand, and told to come back when we could leave our passports.  All our hard work right down the drain…at least for another month.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, because I am writing about our trip, we were successful in finally getting our visas and everything else slowly but surely fell into place.  The three weeks we spent in St. Petersburg were full of all kinds of confusing, unfamiliar, and unforgettable moments, but my favorite one of all was eating with babushka.  One Sunday afternoon one of the girls in my program took us to her grandparents flat outside of St. Petersburg for a traditional Russian meal.  I was pretty pumped about the whole thing because I love trying local cuisine, especially when it’s home-cooked.  On our bus ride there, we were warned that her grandparents didn’t speak any English.  The only words I knew in Russian were hello, thank you and goodbye, which wasn’t going to get us very far.  When we walked into the very small, modest flat, we were immediately greeted by a huge smile and lots of words that we didn’t understand.  She ushered us into the living room which clearly had been set up with a nice table setting just for us.  The conversation started slow, with introductions and basic questions you ask when meeting someone new, and my new friend translating everything we said to each other.  And then came the food, and with that a flood of conversation and laughter around the table.  Babushka (Russian for grandmother) led the conversation and instigated fits of laughter with everything she said.  At one point she asked Scott what he did for a living and he responded, not going into detail, that he worked with computers for a U.S. company.  &lt;em&gt;Soooo, you’re a spy?!&lt;/em&gt;  she asked, with a sly smile on her face.  &lt;em&gt;Babushka!!&lt;/em&gt; - my friend immediately scolded her and we all had a good laugh.  By the end of our time there we had accumulated hand knit socks, a traditional Gzhel ceramic horse and one of her beloved postcards of Russian art.  It was so special.  I will never forget how warm and generous she was, inviting strangers into her home and spoiling us with delicious food and showering us with gifts.  And I will always think of her when I am curled up on the couch in my multi-colored socks.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m back!  To Finland and to blogging.  With the last several months of travel, family and friends, updating the blog got pushed to the back burner.  But with our return to Finland, we’re starting to get back into the swing of things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several travel posts which have gotten backed up, starting with Geneva.  Three weeks after we got back from Ireland we left to meet our good friends, Kendall and Will, on the tail end of their Europe trip.  It was just a brief stay in Geneva, but so so worth it.  You can go anywhere with these people and have the time of your life, they seriously make everything fun.  But this city, &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt;, gorgeous.  Everything was postcard worthy.  Well, everything besides the red-light district, where we stayed.  Let me explain.  When we were looking for a place to stay, months before, we looked everywhere.  Geneva is not exactly the cheapest place in the world, so we scoured the internet to find a place in our budget.  Kendall &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; found one, sent it to all of us to approve, we checked it out, looked good, so we booked it.  So then it’s about a month away, Scott and I are sitting around in Ireland and I’m suddenly curious about where exactly we are staying when we get to Geneva.  I put the address in my phone and it pinpoints a place in France.  So I double check that I have the address right.  Yep.  &lt;em&gt;Hmmm&lt;/em&gt;.  Text to Kendall - &lt;em&gt;Hey, can you send me the address of our hotel because I think I have the wrong one.  It says it’s in France.&lt;/em&gt;  Moments later I get a text back - &lt;em&gt;What?!? Mine says that too!&lt;/em&gt;  After a frantic search and realization that we could get a refund, we realized that it was on LAKE Geneva.  Turns out that’s not only in Geneva (&lt;em&gt;word to the wise&lt;/em&gt;).  Long story short, we found one hotel, IN Geneva, that was within our price range and close to the area that we wanted to be in.  We had a read a little something about there being some &lt;em&gt;ladies&lt;/em&gt; around this hotel, but at this point that didn’t even faze us.  So a month later, when we’re walking through the adorable city of Geneva to our hotel, I was immediately a little taken aback when I saw the short shorts (it was definitely not warm enough for those).  And then it came back to me.  &lt;em&gt;Ooooohhhhhh, yeah&lt;/em&gt;.  I shot a quick glance at Scott and he knew exactly what I was thinking.  So I guess there are some not so nice areas too, but that’s what gives it character, &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the pretty parts.  We took the train to Lutry one day for some wine tasting and although it was not exactly what we expected, the town was everything you could wish for in a little Swiss town.  Despite our best efforts to research before we went, we didn’t have a ton of information about how thing whole wine tasting thing was supposed to work here.  One tip we read said that we should just go around knocking on doors and asking for wine.  So you can&amp;#39;t blame us if we were a little skeptical about how that was going to go.  When we got to Lutry we took the approach of asking random people on the street and in shops, where we could go to taste wine.  Every response consisted of pointing and &lt;em&gt;ummm, there is a place down/up the street/a couple streets&lt;/em&gt;.  So we wandered.  Luckily, Lutry is a great place for aimless wandering.  It’s a small town right on the lake with breathtaking views.  &lt;em&gt;What more could you ask for?&lt;/em&gt;  Wine.  We came for wine.  So we continued our search.  On one of the final tips from a friendly shop owner, we found what I’ll equate to a wine tasting room.  We walked up to the bar, expecting a set tasting that we could order, and found no such thing.  So we proceeded to describe to the bartender what we were looking for.  &lt;em&gt;Oh, I can do that&lt;/em&gt; - was the response.  &lt;em&gt;Perfect&lt;/em&gt;.  So we sat and waited for the wines.  He came, placed the wine glasses on the table, and very kindly described them for us and answered all of our questions.  Then when he left we looked at each other.  There were three wine glasses, with three different wines, and there were three of us.  Not to be picky here, but we are just used to getting a “tasting” each, which means each person gets to taste several wines.  So we politely asked the bartender if we could have two more, as in tastings.  He looked at us, furrowed his brow, paused for a second, and said (in a tone that was confused by the ridiculousness of the request) &lt;em&gt;why don’t I just bring you some more glasses so you can split the wine?&lt;/em&gt;  Oh, yes, of course, that’s a much better idea.  &lt;em&gt;Crazy Americans&lt;/em&gt;.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the time was just blah.  You know, like boat rides, hiking, delicious fondue, more wine, that kind of stuff.  I won’t bore you with all the details.    &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Ireland Travel Tips</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/Ireland+Travel+Tips/Mountains_Lighthouse.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Everything we ate in Ireland was pretty heavenly.  We spent most of our time in small towns so there were only a limited number of restaurants to pick from, but I don’t think you can go wrong.  Seafood on the west coast is abundant.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Long Dock&lt;/u&gt; (in Loophead): This the restaurant that we were looking for when we ran into the cute little Irish children riding their bikes.  They serve tons of locally caught seafood.  The seafood chowder is uh-mazing (Scott ate seafood chowder at every restaurant we went to and he vouches for this).  Make sure to check out their craft beer list!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ashe’s Bar &amp;amp; Restaurant&lt;/u&gt; (in Dingle): Another great seafood restaurant in the heart of Dingle (embrace the seafood).  The first time we tried to go for lunch and it was packed, which is always a good sign.  We made sure to come back extra early the next day to get a table.  If you order the lobster they take you over to their tank and let you pick out which lobster will end up on your plate!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Idas Restaurant&lt;/u&gt; (in Dingle): This would be a great choice if you were in the mood for a slighter fancier (and more expensive) restaurant.  If you get there before 6:00 you can order from their early bird menu, so I would recommend making plans for an early meal if you’re going for dinner (this was not a problem for my dad).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/Ireland+Travel+Tips/Dingle_sheep+grazing.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The west coast of Ireland is all about the B&amp;amp;B’s.  You can find some really great, affordable places in all of the small towns. Plus, you get to enjoy a traditional Irish breakfast and get insider tips from the owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Waters Edge B&amp;amp;B&lt;/u&gt; (in Kilkee):  We started out with this winner of a Bed and Breakfast on our first night.  The inside is so cute and the rooms are fantastic.  It looks out over the water so you get to fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean.  Kilkee is a really small town so you only have to walk about 10 minutes to get to the few restaurants and shops in town.  We only stayed one night here and we spent most of the day in Loophead, which is definitely worth the trip.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Duin House B&amp;amp;B&lt;/u&gt; (in Dingle): The couple that owns this B&amp;amp;B was so warm and welcoming.  They greeted us with tea and crumpets (I don’t really even know what crumpets are, I just couldn’t &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; call them that).  They provided us with maps and gave us great recommendations of things to do while we were in Dingle.  The rooms have everything you need AND there are sheep next door.  So you will awake with a lovely wake up call from the sheep (it really adds to the whole experience).    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ocean View B&amp;amp;B&lt;/u&gt; (in Cahersiveen): This B&amp;amp;B was nothing fancy, but was perfect for a one night stay.  We arrived too early for check-in, but our host was very accommodating and gave us some suggestions of things to do for the next few hours.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/Ireland+Travel+Tips/Dingle_boat+and+houses.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPLORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Kilkee &amp;amp; Loophead&lt;/u&gt;: We didn’t actually do much other than eat in Kilkee.  We mainly chose to stay there because it seemed to have more options and was a bigger town than Loophead.  The main attraction here is the Loophead lighthouse and cliffs.  We chose to stop here instead of Cliffs of Moher because it was more on our route and I read than it had less of a tourist crowd.  It was humbling experience to stand on the edge of the cliffs, looking down at the vast ocean.  You can also take a short tour of the lighthouse where you will learn about its history and how it is still in use today.  While you’re in Loophead, take a walk through the town and have lunch at one of the family owned restaurants.  If you’re staying in Kilkee, you could just take a half day to explore the town of Loophead.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dingle&lt;/u&gt;: This was the biggest town that we stayed in on the coast and the one that we spent the most time in.  We spent about two days here, which seemed to be just the right amount of time to get a good taste of the town.  The first day we drove along the “Dingle Way”, which is a big loop around the area with several points of interest along the way.  You could easily spend an entire day on this, taking your time at all the different points along the way.  There’s so many places on the drive when the view changes and you’ll just want to stop to take it all in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Dingle is really cute too.  There’s many different art galleries and craft shops that you’ll want to take a peek in.  We probably spent half a day just walking around looking at everything.  Also, this area of Ireland is one of the most highly populated areas of Irish speakers.  (We learned that outside of Ireland the language is called Gaelic, but within Ireland they refer to it as Irish).  If you’re driving along the Atlantic coast, I highly recommend spending some time in Dingle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cahersiveen&lt;/u&gt;: Valentia Island is just off the coast of Cahersiveen, which has some good hiking and sightseeing.  It was really foggy the morning that we went so we didn’t get to see as much as we would have liked, but what we did see was incredible.  The other thing that we would have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked to do was hike Skellig Michael.  Skilling Michael is another small island in the Atlantic Ocean where a Christian monastery was founded somewhere between the 6th and 8th centuries.  The island itself is highly affected by the wether conditions in the Atlantic, which is why we were unable to go while we were there.  It’s not an experience for everyone, as the hike up the rock seems to be pretty intense.  But if you’re looking for an adventure, and the boats are running while you’re there, you should look into it.  I still want to go back there someday.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rent a car.  From what I’ve read and seen, there’s not a very extensive public transportation system in Ireland, especially along the coast.  It makes life so much easier because you decide when you want to move on to the next town and when you need an extra few hours.  If you’re not used to driving on the left side of the road, it will take some getting used to, but completely do-able (so I’ve heard, I didn’t actually do the driving).  Take the scenic route from town to town, there’s some incredible view along the way where you’ll want to stop and take pictures or just rest for a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we left the lively town of Dingle, our next stop as we headed south was Cahersiveen.  We didn’t even know how to pronounce the name of the town, much less what to do once we got there.  Fortunately, the owner of our Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast gave us the low down on everything we needed to know once we got there.  Cahersiveen is a super tiny town, but off its coast is Valentia Island and a bit further into the Atlantic is Skellig Michael.  Valentia Island has an interesting history (it was the place where the first transatlantic cables operated between Europe and North America), along with its diverse landscape, which make it a great place to explore.  We decided to tackle the island one morning before heading on to our last stop of the trip.  When we started our drive it was so foggy that we could hardly see 10 feet in front of us, which didn’t bode well for all the amazing views we had been promised.  We pressed on anyway.  We stopped at all the different points of interest on our map and eventually got to the lighthouse.  We parked the car and made the trek down to the peninsula.  When we got close we could see there was a sign hanging on the closed gates.  &lt;em&gt;Not a good sign.&lt;/em&gt;  We finally got close enough to read that the lighthouse was closed due to weather.  The sky was dark, the fog was still holding up and the wind was howling pretty fiercely.  Although I was slightly bummed about not getting to go into the lighthouse, being that close to the wild, angry ocean somehow felt even more exciting.  I don’t know what it is, but being outside when the weather is so intense (when you’re somewhat prepared for it) gives me this thrilling rush.  It feels like I’m pushing myself up to the edge and looking down a steep cliff.  Then just when I feel like I’ve stayed there long enough to feel a small sense of accomplishment (or uncomfortableness), I walk away to a warm, dry car.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finished our sightseeing around the island, we took the scenic route to Cork.  I’m not kidding when I say this route was the most scenic of all the scenic routes.  It was also quite possibly one of the most windy routes I’ve ever taken (&lt;em&gt;and I thought I had grown out of that car sickness thing&lt;/em&gt;).   Even during the times when I had to lay my head down and close my eyes, I forced myself to peek out the window every now and then because I couldn’t risk missing any of the jaw-dropping views.  I made a mental note of some of the places that I wanted to come back and visit someday (Killarney National Park, I&amp;#39;m talking to you).  I mean, I knew Ireland had some pretty places, but it was so much more than I expected.  There’s so many places to see and things to do that I didn’t want it to end.  But I told myself that I wasn&amp;#39;t saying goodbye forever, and someday I’d be back for more.                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our week in England, we popped over to Ireland for the next week.  At this point in the summer I had done so much planning for our previous trips that this one kind of got put on the back burner.  I booked places to stay and had an idea of some of the things we could do in each town, but it wasn’t put through my typically extensive planning regimen.  Lucky for us, Ireland turned out to be the perfect place for that type of minimal planning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first day, we drove out to the town of Loophead for lunch and planned to make a stop at the lighthouse.  Like many of the towns along the west coast, Loophead is a small town with more sheep than people (I don’t know if that’s actually true, but it sure seemed like it).  You would think that would make it really easy to find your way around.  &lt;em&gt;Wrong.&lt;/em&gt;  Unless you happen upon two little Irish children with fiery red hair and the most adorable accents you’ve ever heard, riding their bikes along the same dirt street that you are driving on, you might be driving in circles for a while.  We stopped to ask the kids for directions and I fully expected them to have no idea what we were talking about, much less be able to give us perfect directions to the restaurant, but that’s just what they did.  &lt;em&gt;Ye can take yer first left at the end of the street, den ye will see the main street and the restaurant will be on yer right.&lt;/em&gt;  It was too much.  I couldn’t stop talking about how ridiculously cute they were.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Irish coast is completely stunning.  Everywhere you look there are the most dramatic cliffs, mountains and fields.  One of my favorite moments was when we were driving along the coast in Dingle and we stumbled upon a beach tucked into the bottom of a cliff.  I desperately wanted to get down onto the beach so I called for a pitstop.  The view was unreal.  Waves crashing in front of you, huge rocks creating secret alcoves scattered around, and then gazing upward, were sheep and cattle grazing at the edge of the cliff.  The wind was blowing so hard that it was almost hard to see at times, but that made it all the more thrilling.  Scott braved the water while the rest of us held on to our rain coats and shouted to be heard over the roaring winds.  We didn&amp;#39;t stay for long, but the time we spent on that little beach is something that I&amp;#39;ll never forget.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything’s funnier in a British accent, don’t you think?  I’m that person that turns around and giggles every time someone says “Cheers!”, even when it’s the 274th time I’ve heard it in a week.  But you know what &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; gets me…little British children.  I mean, can you think of anything cuter than a three year-old telling his &lt;em&gt;mummy&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks going to the zoo this afternoon is going to be &lt;em&gt;quite lovely&lt;/em&gt;?  That’s because there isn’t.  Nothing tops that.  Our days were filled with practicing of our own British accents every chance we got, which was &lt;em&gt;quite often&lt;/em&gt;.  I’m not sure if everyone else got quite the kick out of our constant impersonations as we did though.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much history in London, and all of England, you could be there for months and still not see everything.  We tried to see all the major tourist sites, while making sure we penciled in plently of time to explore slowly (ie., our weekend in Brighton).  It was so fun wandering around London with my dad on his first trip to Europe; we had some good quailty father-daughter time.  I think this trip may have hooked him.  He&amp;#39;ll be back to Europe again.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, I’ve decided that I’m going to start adding some “tips” to our travel posts.  They’ll be some of our favorite things that we did/ate while we were there and maybe some helpful suggestions, so that others can learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;LONDON TRAVEL TIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We stayed in a neighborhood called Hackney, which is in East London.  The area is more “up and coming”, meaning there’s some nicer areas right next to some not-so-nice areas.  Hackney has some really nice restaurants and shops and it’s cheaper than staying in the center of London, but if you’re planning on going into the center everyday then I’d probably stay a little closer.  The Tube has easy and convenient connections pretty much everywhere, but it can add some time to your day if you’re going far, especially during rush hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best EATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Clapton Hart&lt;/u&gt;: Really good pub food and atmosphere.  They only have a few things on their menu, but they’re all spot on.  I recommend the Bean Burger. We went here twice during the 5 days we were in London, if that tells you anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yum Yum Thai Restaurant&lt;/u&gt;: We had SO much food here and it was all delicious.  But maybe don’t order a Seafood sampler and an entrée each, unless you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hungry, then you should, because your stomach and tastebuds will thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;El Olivo&lt;/u&gt;: My dad says these were the best tapas that he’s ever had.  I don’t know how many times he’s actually had tapas though, so I’m going to vouch for them too.  They were darn good.  And what are tapas without sangria? &lt;em&gt;Get it.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Thing(s) We Did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Parliament House&lt;/u&gt;: I’ll admit, I thought this tour was going to be really lame (I’m pretty particular about tours), but it was actually very interesting.  We did the audio tour and I’d say it was definitely worth it.  It was very well organized and not very crowded (compared to some of the other touristy places). We learned a lot about the history and current happenings of the Parliment.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Football Match&lt;/u&gt;: If you&amp;#39;re into football (soccer) and have a chance, go to a match. It&amp;#39;s quite the experience, the hardcore/rowdy fans really get you into the spirit and you get a little taste of the strong culture around the sport.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember that England likes to be a little unique and has different outlets than the rest of Europe, so make sure you check that you have the right adapters when you go (i.e., be smarter than us).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BRIGHTON TRAVEL TIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Regency Lansdowne Guest House&lt;/u&gt;: Mike, the owner of the B&amp;amp;B, was so incredibly kind and accommodating and prepared a yummy breakfast every morning.  The rooms were very nice and Mike provides you with everything you need…even outlet adapters, for those, &lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;, forgetful travelers.  The house is actually located in Hove, but Brighton and Hove are neighboring towns situated right next to each other.  We walked from our B&amp;amp;B in Hove all the way to the Brighton Pier (and we weren’t huffing and puffing when we got there). An extra plus is that the beach is just a 2 minute walk down the street! You can see it from the steps of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best EATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Archipelagos Taverna&lt;/u&gt;: Some good Greek food can be found here.  I got a Greek salad and an order of baked white beans.  I know, it doesn’t sound all that enticing, but my husband and dad practically ate all the beans off my plate, that’s how good they were.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Thing(s) We Did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take a walk along the beach! We started in Hove (from our B&amp;amp;B) and strolled down the shore, stopping to listen to outdoor karaoke and watch the street performers, until we got to Brighton Pier.  Then we cut back up through the town, winding through the side streets decorated with millions of shops.  Seriously, &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt;.  Then, come evening time, buy yourself a bottle of wine and some sandwich fixin’s and make your way back out to the beach and enjoy the sunset over the water.  It’s all about the beach here.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are looking for a weekend escape, this is the place for you.  There’s not many &lt;em&gt;sites&lt;/em&gt; to see, but there’s plenty of restaurants, shopping and shoreline waiting for you.  We didn’t experience the nightlife, but it looked and sounded like it was pretty lively, at least on the weekends.  Cute little town overall.  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Copenhagen | Round Two</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2014/houses.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the thing, the picture above, it’s actually from the first time that I went to Copenhagen with my mom.  This time around we were still traveling with our friends, Kevin and Debrán, and well, the weather was not all that great.  It was pretty chilly and it rained practically the entire time we were there.  That’s not to say that we didn’t have a great time, it’s just that I didn’t really take any pictures.  This time around it wasn’t so much about the sites we saw or even the food we ate (although it was still amazing), the best part of our time in Copenhagen actually revolved around a foosball table.  I’ve never really been a big fan of foosball, probably because I’ve never been very good at it, and it just seemed kind of dumb (probably because I never won).  But Kevin and Debrán wound up with a foosball table in their flat, so after dinner our first night, we decided to give it a try.  After Debrán effortlessly scored the first goal, like she’d been secretly training all her life, we couldn’t stop playing.  I don’t know if it was the dreary weather, or the fact that by game two we all had been nicknamed according to our style of play, or maybe it was the super competitiveness coming out in all of us.  Anyway, we were all hooked.  I’m sure we woke up the neighbors with our fits of laughter and the occasional scream at our teammates, the tiny plastic ones.  So that’s what happened every night, a foosball rematch, until one of the teams barely squeaked out a win (&lt;em&gt;oh, it’s not over yet&lt;/em&gt;).  And it was the best ending to a really great trip.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day we got to Bergen it was pouring rain and pretty darn chilly.  Scott and I came completely unprepared, with no rain jackets and barely any warm clothing.  We had gotten used to the nice warm weather we’d been having way too easily and forgotten that these places require jackets and scarfs for most of the year.  Our traveling buddies, however, came far more prepared than we did.  Which shouldn’t have come as a surprise since they’re always far more prepared than us (&lt;em&gt;that’s why we’re friends&lt;/em&gt;).  We made the decision that we weren’t going to let the rain get in our way of seeing this Norwegian city though.  After all, Bergen has over 230 days of annual rainfall (&lt;em&gt;we found out once we were there&lt;/em&gt;).  So we trudged out into the city with wet clothes and smiles on our faces (sort of).  One of the things that our host warned us about (but definitely not the most shocking) was the high cost of eating at restaurants in Norway.  Most locals cook at home to keep costs down and rarely eat out.  So we followed her advice and went to the fish market to buy our dinner.  After gathering all the supplies to make dinner, we took the short cut back to our place.  This is the other &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt; thing that our host warned us about.  Across the street from the apartment that we were renting, was a well known drug park.  Everyone knew it, even the police, and apparently they had made the decision to leave all the druggies be, as long as they kept to the park.  We were warned that we would see all kinds of &lt;em&gt;crrrrazy&lt;/em&gt; stuff going on in the park.  &lt;em&gt;It’s like your own private show, right outside your window,&lt;/em&gt; she explained, laughing. We all laughed with her.  Then when she left we looked at each other, completely stunned.  Not exactly the kind of welcoming we had imagined.  But then we laughed again, for real this time, and took the long way to the market.  Well on the way back it was raining, like really raining, and we were carrying heavy bags of groceries.  So we opted for the short cut through the park, after all, she assured us it was completely safe.  &lt;em&gt;Don’t look at them, walk fast, but not too fast, act like we’re talking&lt;/em&gt;…these were the things we reminded each other of before embarking on the 2 minute walk through the park.  &lt;em&gt;Ok, we’re almost there.  Which way is it?  I think it’s this way.  Wait, maybe it’s that way.  Just keep walking!&lt;/em&gt; - as we basically slid down a steep muddy hill, which was clearly not the path to our apartment.   But looking lost in the middle of the drug park was not an option, so we acted as if we needed a good challenge.  Sidewalks bore us.  We successfully made it back, after what seemed like 2 &lt;em&gt;very long&lt;/em&gt; minutes.  We earned some serious bravery points for that, I’m sure.  I mean, no big deal, we’re hardcore.                     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our first day there, mother nature pleasantly surprised us with lots of sun and very minimal rain.  I think that I can speak for the group when I say that the best part of our stay in Bergen was the day we took the ferry through the Sognefjord.  To get to the fjord we took a train and a bus through some of the most stunning landscapes I’ve ever seen.  The kind that that make it on postcards.  It was unreal.  But the ferry through the fjord was definitely the cherry on top.  The greenest greens and the bluest blues you’ve ever seen.  Waterfalls every time you turned your head.  Mountains coming straight out of the river, on both sides, decorated every so often with a tiny cluster of houses.  Better than the pictures.  It was, without a doubt, worth &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; walks through the drug park.                     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this next round of travels, not only did we have some exciting Scandinavian cities to visit, but we also had some of our favorite people join us!  We met Kevin and Debrán in Stockholm to start the trip and, despite their luggage getting lost by the airlines, it was a pretty great kickoff.  We decided that the best way to see the city (and save our feet) was to join the hordes of commuting bike riders.  On our first day with the bikes we took them exploring through one of the many islands which was, apparently, one of the &lt;em&gt;cool kid&lt;/em&gt; hangouts during the summer.  Stockholm is pretty cool like that.  They have all these random, &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt; parks all over the place where you can find pretty much the entire population of the city on a nice summer evening.  So we followed suit and did our fair share of sitting, laying, picnic-ing on the grass, soaking up as much of summer as these Scandinavian countries offer.  Then we fantasized about buying one of those adorable houses on the water and going on bike rides everyday around the islands, picking fresh apples and maybe even building up the courage to swim in the frigid water. Yeah, I know, I do that everywhere I go.  I can’t help it, I like to dream.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark has definitely made its way onto my list of “places I could live”.  The food really helped give it a good shove up the list.  I still daydream about it.  Scott and I have become major porridge fans since living in Finland and Copenhagen has a restaurant dedicated SOLELY to porridge. Score! But it’s really more than just food (although that might be enough to make me move there).  Everything is just so…pretty.  They’ve really got that whole Scandinavian design thing going for them.  Copenhagen has all that you could want in a big city without feeling too big.  And when you want to escape from all the fuss of the city, well you can just have a picnic in the cemetery, like we did.  To tell you the truth, I was a little skeptical about this whole idea at first, but the first time we walked through and saw locals running, sun bathing and enjoying their lunch, I was convinced.  It’s basically a giant park.  And what better way to use such a space on a sunny afternoon, than a picnic.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people in Denmark also helped make it so wonderful.  They are so down to earth and friendly, which really worked in my favor, since I had a couple of &lt;em&gt;moments&lt;/em&gt; during our time there.  It started the first day we were in Copenhagen. After our first super delicious meal, I left my jacket (the only one I brought) at the restaurant.  We were mid-way through the Superkilen park when I realized (and panicked).  I walked just about as fast as I could, without looking like a lunatic, back to the restaurant.  Luckily, my jacket was waiting for me just inside the door.  The second time I tested the Danes was while we were walking to the canals.  On the way we decided to pop into in several boutique-y shops.  Well, I found a really nice piece of pottery and I wanted to see how much it cost.  So I picked it up.  Unfortunately there were two pieces to this particular item and I only picked up the top part.  After that, all I remember is the entire thing on the floor, in a million pieces.  (Although I did manage to see the price, which was equivalent to $100.)  First, the sweet woman working looked stunned, like she didn’t know what to do.  (Probably because nothing like that had ever happened before…oops.) Then she quickly went to clean it up and told us not to worry about it.  After helping her clean, I could not get out of the store fast enough.  The rest of the trip I had someone looking over my shoulder to make sure I wasn’t touching anything breakable, &lt;em&gt;thanks mom&lt;/em&gt;.  The last little mishap, was not so little after all.  See, I bought train tickets from Copenhagen to Aarhus. Or at least I thought I did.  And what does one do when they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they buy train tickets? Well, they get on the train.  Turns out (after three different people tried to figure out &lt;em&gt;what in the world&lt;/em&gt; was going on with our tickets) I had bought bus tickets instead.  &lt;em&gt;Whoops&lt;/em&gt;.  But we were already on the train on our way to Aarhus.  So thankfully, the super kind ticket checker let us slide.  I told you those Danes were nice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that I made such a good impression on them, soon they&amp;#39;ll be begging me to move there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so exciting to get to show someone around where you live.  Although tons of people have seen pictures and heard stories, nothing beats seeing it in person.  There’s not many “sights” to see in Joensuu so when I was showing my mom around the city it was more like, “This is the grocery store we go to” and “Here’s the university” and “Look, those are the people washing their rugs at the river”.  Luckily, my mom is into that kind of stuff.  She will get equally as excited about visiting a new grocery store as she would about seeing the Eiffel Tower - so that worked in my favor.  And the rug washing, well she was ALL about that.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had this old rug of ours that had been sitting on our balcony for months (because I was too lazy to take it downstairs to throw it away) that had a giant red stain on it that would not come out.  (Seriously, I tried everything).  Even after it had been rained and snowed on, my mom was convinced that the rug was salvageable with a good ole scrub at the river.  After studying the ways of the river washers and scouting out a perfect spot, we hauled the rug out.  Once we got to our spot and began mimicking the routine of the other washers, we realized we had a big problem.  Everyone else had these special rug brushes and pine soap that seemed to do the trick, and all we had was my dish scrubber and dish washing soap.  In attempt to act like we knew what we were doing, we hid the soap inside our bag and began scrubbing.  Except we couldn’t fool the lady next to us.  She saw right through our act.  Fortunately, she took pity on us and let us use all her gear while she was waiting for her rug to dry.  She even taught us the ways of the Finnish rug scrub.  We scrubbed that rug like mad until we couldn’t scrub anymore.  Then we waited all day to return to see if our hard work had paid off.  And it did!! I’m not going to say that the rug is as good as new, because if you looked hard enough (ok, you don’t even have to look that hard), you can still see a little discoloration.  But we just shoved that part under the couch and pretend it’s not there.  What would I do without mom to save the day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we took the train from my small, sweet town of Joensuu to the big city.  I’d been to Helsinki a number of times before, but you just can’t beat it in the summertime.  Especially when you spend the day at one of the many islands off the coast, like we did.  It was a bright, sunny and warm day that we took the ferry out to Suomenlinna and spent the day exploring the island and enjoying the weather.  It was perfect.  Although Suomenlinna is one of Helsinki’s most popular tourist attractions, it’s still Finland, so really not that touristy at all.  We found a place on the rocks to watch all the crazy people plunge into the ice water.  And because I’m kind of, maybe just a little bit competitive, I decided that I wanted to feel how cold this water really was.  I mean, if they’re doing it, I can do it.  As I started walking to the water, my mom, in true mom fashion, warned me to be careful on the moss, “It’s slippery”, she said.  &lt;em&gt;Yeah, yeah.&lt;/em&gt;  When I got to the edge of the dry rocks and put one foot on the first mossy rock, I was reminded that moms are usually right.  I slipped and fell right into the water.  So instead of just touching it with my hands, like I intended, I got a little more of the full experience.  Luckily, I wasn’t very far in and I didn’t hurt anything, so we just laughed about it for a good long while. That&amp;#39;s really why I did it, for the laughs.                       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome seems like such a long time ago.  I guess it’s because we’ve been so many places since then.  The words that come to my head when I think back on our time in Rome are: hot, gelato and ancient.  I think that pretty much sums it up.  The daily routine went something like this - visit ancient building and/or church, marvel at how old and amazing it is, start getting really hot, escape to a restaurant for some AC, walk around some more, get hot again, eat gelato, eat pizza or pasta, repeat.  Mmmm…gelato.        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of those who have prayed, hoped and wished for warm weather to make its way to Finland, thank you, it has.  Now if we could work on a little AC up in here, that’d be really cool (no pun intended). I am so thankful for and loving all this warm weather and sunshine that we’ve been getting, really I am.  Everyone is happy, people are out and about and picnics are happening all over the city.  It’s the best.  But when it’s 80+ outside and you have to be inside, with no AC, well let’s just say if it weren’t for the mosquitos I’d be sleeping in the forest.  When the wind blows our door closed, I sprint to prop it back open to prevent an immediate pool of sweat and suffocation.  I have my fly swatter (thanks mom) ready at all times in case one of those annoying creatures tries to sneak their way through the open windows and doors.  But I know that sooner than I care to admit the chilling winds will be back again and open windows won’t even be an option, so I’m going to turn that fan on high and keep reminding myself that it’s better than frozen eyelashes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a little over a month ago we took a trip to Paris for a week with Scott’s parents.  I’m going to blame the fact that I’m just now writing about it on the mere three weeks that I’ve spent in Joensuu since the beginning of June AND my little motivation to do anything that involves my legs sticking to a chair while staring at a computer.  Yep, that’s my excuse.  My idea of Paris was pretty much the same one that is portrayed on TV.  Beautiful, wonderful, romantic…just about everything perfect squished into one city.  There’s so much hype around the city that I thought there was no way it could live up to my (and many people’s) expectations.  But as cliché as it sounds, I did kind of fall just a little bit in love with the city.  The museums, churches and Eiffel Tower are all amazing, but what I really loved was the everyday kind of stuff.  Like the millions of cafés lining every street, filled with people enjoying the weather and good company.  And the parks, or just dots of green, for people to bring their picnics of baguettes, cheese and a bottle of wine (yes, that actually happens in real life).  Oh, and all the buildings.  I just couldn’t get enough of the white-grayish old buildings that give the city it’s relaxed, romantic feel.  It also didn’t hurt that we had near perfect weather the entire time we were there, which really makes everything better.  I don’t know what it is about the city. You can do nothing except sit at a café and people-watch, and at the end of the day you still feel like you’ve had a pretty solid day.  But that’s what’s so great about it. &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Gdańsk, Poland</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 5:00 am, rolled out of bed, stumbled downstairs to pick up our carefully packed breakfast and began our journey to Gdańsk.  The first 2 hours on the bus were pretty silent.  Occasionally you could hear a short mumbled conversation, but for the most far it was silent, with heads bobbing up and down, trying desperately to get more sleep.  As we arrived in Gdańsk, heads began to perk up and eyes were peeled open to take in the new city.  Our first stop was a boat ride and tour of some of the historical WWII sites.  Seeing the city by boat was a fun new perspective as we watched people enjoying the warm sun and the colorful waterfront buildings pass by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;After a big helping of pierogi (Polish dumplings) for lunch, we spent some time walking around the city, marveling at the beautiful churches and mesmerizing buildings.  Gdańsk is known as the capital of amber, with tons of street vendors displaying an array of jewelry made with the Baltic gold, so of course we couldn’t leave without some time spent shopping.  Our last stop, before heading back, was a quick trip to the beach on the Baltic Sea.  The beach was packed with people lounging in padded beach chairs, under umbrellas and a few brave souls who ventured out to the frigid water.  We left Gdańsk beat from the long, action-packed day, while simultaneously craving more time in the lively port town.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with all that the city had to offer from the rich history, the cheerful old town and the lovely beaches.  I couldn’t help but think about what a perfect weekend getaway destination it would be.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, YAY we’re back in Joensuu!  The past month has been full of fun times and great memories, but I sure was ready to be back in my own bed.  The first two weeks of the trip I was in Toruń, Poland working with students from three other countries on an intensive summer course.  The topic was building intercultural awareness in teaching English as a foreign language.  We arrived late Sunday night after a 4.5 hour train to Helsinki, 2 hour flight to Warsaw and then a 4 hour bus ride to Toruń.  Then early Monday morning we were up for the beginning of ten long days in class (don&amp;#39;t worry, we managed to squeeze in some time for fun).  There were nine other students from UEF that went on the trip, so I got to make some pretty great friends as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about Poland.  Go there.  Seriously, it’s such an interesting, beautiful country filled with so much history.  In Toruń there was a wonderful Old Town filled with ornate, colorful buildings that I could just stare at all day (maybe that’s why I have so many pictures of them).  And because we were studying with Polish students, we also got to learn a lot about Polish culture. For instance, what I would call ‘lunch’ they refer to as ‘dinner’ and it’s eaten at around 1 pm.  The meal generally consists of three courses and starts with a soup, then you have the entrée, which is usually some sort of meat and potatoes, and then a dessert.  Later you have ‘supper’ which is around 6 pm and is generally some form of sandwich.  Being in Poland, we followed the same daily meal schedule.  I always find it interesting to learn about other food cultures.  I think you can tell a lot about a culture from how and what they eat.  We also learned a little about Nicolaus Copernicus, who is the pride and joy of Toruń.  There&amp;#39;s a statue of him in the center of the old town and the univeristy, where we were studying, is named after him.  As our welcoming gift, we all got Nicolaus Copernicus zip drives!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we were in class a lot, there were still plenty late nights hanging out with new friends from Spain, France, Poland (and of course, Finland).  That was the best part of the trip.  Just talking, laughing and being with those people.  After two weeks of cramming in a ridiculous amount of work and play, I was completely worn out, but it was so so worth it.           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother Nature really pulled through this weekend.  Clear skies and rising temperatures made for a pretty perfect market day.  The first traditional fish market in Joensuu was held on Saturday where vendors sold fresh fish, homemade jams, wooden handicrafts and lots of other goodies.  We sat outside eating our crucified salmon and all our winter woes were forgotten.  There’s just something about outdoor markets that makes me smile.  I don’t know if it’s the warm weather that generally accompanies them, the smell of freshly cooked food or the community feel to the whole event, but it sure makes for a solid afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t want to disappoint anyone by skipping over the weather report, so here it goes, today was &lt;strong&gt;hot&lt;/strong&gt;.  I know you’re thinking, &lt;em&gt;you mean like you only had to wear one pair of wool socks kind of weather?&lt;/em&gt;  Nope.  Like shorts and sandals and sunbathing kind of weather.  Seriously.  The city was crawling with people soaking it all up.  I’d say about 50% of the people we passed were carrying ice cream cones (including me).  Every pier we passed on the way home was occupied by picnic-ers.  We bought a fan.  These are the signs of summer.  I’m still a bit hesitant to leave the house without gloves and a jacket, I just feel naked without them, but I’m sure pretty soon I won’t be giving them a second thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and the last, &lt;em&gt;but definitely not the least&lt;/em&gt;, glorious thing to report, we ate barbecue today.  I’m not talking about Finnish BBQ, which really just involves cooking anything over an open fire, I mean like a legit pulled pork sandwich.  In the middle of downtown Joensuu, there is a man from Florida that cooks up some serious Texas-style barbecue.  I was tempted to run around with my sandwich introducing everyone to the deliciousness of real BBQ so they could see what they’d been missing out on all this time.  Instead, I sat in the scorching sun with BBQ sauce all over my face and for a moment I felt like I was back in Texas.  Funny how food can do that to you (&lt;em&gt;or is that just me?&lt;/em&gt;)                    &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>May Day</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/05.03.2014/Balloons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyvää Vappua! Happy May Day! We&amp;#39;ve had quite the busy week over here celebrating.  Vappu is the second biggest holiday celebration in Finland (first being Midsummers).  I&amp;#39;ve never seen so many people out in Joensuu – I didn&amp;#39;t even know that many people lived here.  Although May Day is officially May 1st, the festivities ran throughout the entire week.  We started the week with the &lt;em&gt;flying flags&lt;/em&gt; event at the university, where we each wrote about our experiences in Finland on the back of our country&amp;#39;s flag.  Then we let them go together to demonstrate what the exchange students bring to Finland.  The next day we went on a bus tour of Eastern Finland.  We stopped at various places to explore and socialize, then we were back on the bus to the next stop.  On Vappu Eve there was a parade of students from the university to an island across town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finland, all students have different colored jumpsuits according to their major.  They collect badges from different events that they take part in and cover their jumpsuits in them.  On special occasions (Vappu being one) all the people that have graduated from basic school (high school) wear their graduation caps proudly.  It&amp;#39;s really a big deal to be able to show off your cap.  After the parade, people gather at the island where there is music playing and they hang out with their friends.  People continue partying wayyy into the night, since the next day is a national holiday.  On the actual day (May 1st), everyone gathers in the city center where there are vendors selling May Day balloons and streamers, a vintage car parade and plenty of socializing.  As the day goes on, people begin to make their way  to the island to have a picnic with their friends and family.  Although it wasn&amp;#39;t exactly picnic weather, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking 35 degrees&lt;/em&gt;, we enjoyed spending time eating with our friends.  All the Vappuu activities may have gotten in the way of a little school work this week, but I can&amp;#39;t miss out on the culture, right?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that every time I start to talk about the &lt;em&gt;amazzzzingly&lt;/em&gt; wonderful weather in Finland, it comes back to haunt me.  Remember last week when I was raving about how perfect the weather was... well I take it back.  It has snowed at least three days since then.  &lt;em&gt;Not cool, Finland, not cool.&lt;/em&gt;  They say that warm weather is coming, but I&amp;#39;ll believe it when I see it.    Yesterday we spent a good amount of time outside, when it suddenly began to snow.  I looked at a Finnish guy near us with what I&amp;#39;m sure was a “&lt;em&gt;you&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding me&lt;/em&gt;” face.  And his apt response was, “&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s Finland, what can I say?&lt;/em&gt;”.  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>It's Spring</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;all, it&amp;#39;s spring in Finland!  From the day we got back it&amp;#39;s been nothing but beautiful weather.  I&amp;#39;m talking sunny days and warm (relatively) temperatures.  I haven&amp;#39;t worn a scarf since we&amp;#39;ve been back.  Yesterday my legs were exposed to the Finnish sun for the first time since September.  Okay, really it was just my ankles, but it was BIG.  It&amp;#39;s been so nice that it&amp;#39;s making it hard to stay inside and concentrate on school work because I just want to live outside.  Picnics are seriously calling my name.  I want to picnic every meal.  Even though this seems like a huge change from the below 30 degree weather when we left in early April, the biggest adjustment has been the sun.  Right now the sun rises before 5:00 am and sets after 9:00 pm.  Which, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, is amaaaaazzzing, but it&amp;#39;s completely throwing us off.  We brought back some black out curtains because, even before we left, the sun was waking us up at 5 every morning.  They work like magic.  The only problem is it is so dark in our room that it makes waking up harder (I&amp;#39;m still going to blame it on the jet lag though).  This weekend we slept till 11 one morning and 10 the next.  I don&amp;#39;t remember the last time I&amp;#39;ve done that.  Then the situation at night is the opposite.  It is so bright outside until about 8:45 that we don&amp;#39;t even start thinking about dinner until at least 8:00.  The sun is turning us into the Spaniards and Greeks.  Last night we ate at 10:00!  And this is not even the most sun we will get.  In June we&amp;#39;ll have 20 hours of sunlight!  Talk about a huge change – in December I was coming out of class at 3:00 to total darkness and now the sun is barely setting when it&amp;#39;s time for me to go to bed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I will be stuck inside some, finishing up these last few weeks of school, there will be plenty of time carved out to enjoy the outdoors.  This week is Vappuu (May Day) and we have lots of fun activities planned!    &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Sunday afternoon bike rides</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/03.10.2014/walking_bw.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sundays are pretty great days.  I hesitate to call them my favorite because Friday and Saturday put up a pretty good fight, so let&amp;#39;s just say they&amp;#39;re top 3.  Even though Sundays back home looked different than they do now, I still treasure my Sundays.  I&amp;#39;ve started a new tradition of making breakfast on the weekends.  It&amp;#39;s one of the best ideas I&amp;#39;ve had.  I love breakfast.  Like love LOVE breakfast.  Hands down my favorite meal.  Lunch and dinner got nothing on breakfast.  The problem is I am usually so hungry in the morning that I can barely pour my cereal fast enough, much less spend any significant amount of time conjuring up a meal that involves turning on the stove.  But in some crazy miraculous change of events, I&amp;#39;ve found a way.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s the promise of something extra delicious to chow down on, &lt;em&gt;who knows&lt;/em&gt;.  This mouth-watering occasion is one reason that I long for Sundays and now I&amp;#39;ve added another.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ride our bikes a lot.  And although they seldom go a day without turning their wheels, they rarely get ridden for pure enjoyment.  Most of the time they are just a means of transportation.  It&amp;#39;s such a shame.  These tired old machines never get to have any fun.  But we have vowed to change that.  A bike ride has now been added to our Sunday routine.  We decided not to wait until the sun comes out and the flowers are blooming to start because, quite frankly, that could be a while.  Today was day 1.  We rode our bikes down our mostly clear sidewalks until there was no more sidewalk.  When the sidewalk ends and you look to the left, you can see a small hill.  The forest lets you see just enough to marvel at it, but keeps some of its treasures hidden to draw you in closer.  We&amp;#39;d been to this spot before when you could see the dirt on the ground, so we wanted to to see what it looked like in its winter attire.  The icy trails forced us to leave our bikes behind, but the small trek through the woods was worth it.  An undiscovered path is on the agenda for next Sunday.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of talking about how done I am with this weather and how the weather in Helsinki was equally as miserable (if not worse) and how all the pictures of warm places with people in anything less than a winter coat and boots are making me crazy... I&amp;#39;m going to tell you about all the food we ate on our trip.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty much what we did.  We ate.  So let&amp;#39;s first talk about the Mexican-style brunch.  Anything with a slight resemblance to Mexican food and we&amp;#39;re there.  I will admit now that it was worth the cold, wet walk over.  I&amp;#39;m not even sure what some of the items were exactly, but I will tell you they were delicious and spicy, just how I like it.  Then there was Fafa&amp;#39;s.  Giant falafals in fluffy pita bread.  I got the one with pesto and goat cheese.  Yes, &lt;em&gt;to die for&lt;/em&gt;.  The restaurant was out of this old, white van look-alike.  Think stationary food truck.  There were only about 15 seats total, which makes you feel like you snagged a highly coveted spot.  It&amp;#39;s located in the middle of a bunch of office buildings, so you would never find it just walking around, but we were on a mission.  Then there&amp;#39;s my favorite, well favorites, which were all the cute cafés around town.  The one that really took the cake (I&amp;#39;ll tell you more about that in a moment) was this small little café tucked in a corner, down the street from where we were staying.  Give me a cinnamon roll or croissant with a cappuccino for breakfast and I am a happy camper.  It&amp;#39;s one of those places that would be very dangerous to live by because it would be calling  my name every time I passed by.  In fact it did one of the days we were there.  We were going to walk by on the way back to our apartment so I took that as an opportunity to try a slice of cake.  I&amp;#39;m not a huge cake person, well really just not a huge frosting person, but these cakes were of the homemade variety.  They were different every day.  &lt;em&gt;Who eats cake in the middle of the day with no special occasion&lt;/em&gt;, you ask?  I asked myself the same question, after my teeth were already covered in chocolatey goodness, and I decided the answer was that people who live by this place do.  So as I was temporarily living there for a couple of days, I should do as the locals do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly we needed some comforting from the weather.  And we found it in the food.  It really is amazing how much the weather dictates what you eat.  So to survive this next month of on and off rain/snow/sleet, we&amp;#39;re going to be making some really comforting food around here.  Starting with our favorite Moroccan-style stew.  Mmmmm...I can already taste those melt-in-your-mouth sweet potatoes infused with the sweet sweet spices.              &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Ski Break</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/03.01.2014/bridge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have Spring break, we have Ski break.  Both occur in March and are all about taking a little time from school to enjoy the outdoors.  Other than that, they have nothing in common.  Spring break is swimming pools, swim suits and sun.  Ski break is snow ball fights, snow shoeing and of course, skiing.  (Ok, I just noticed that they all start with S&amp;#39;s too...so there&amp;#39;s that).  I&amp;#39;m all about these sorts of icy outings and I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been a pretty darn good sport about the winter, but I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and call it.  I can not fool my Texas brain into thinking we&amp;#39;re still in December.  It knows better.  It knows that this is the time to start breaking out the shorts and eating outside.  This snow just isn&amp;#39;t going to do it for me anymore.  I&amp;#39;m on board for it coming back in about 8 months.  But now, it&amp;#39;s time to stop this madness.  It&amp;#39;s been real.  Needless to say, we are not headed for the slopes next week.  We&amp;#39;re boarding the train headed south.  Literally.  We&amp;#39;re going to Helsinki.  Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s not exactly beachy there either, but we&amp;#39;ll take what we can get right now.  If you could direct any heat waves that you find in this general direction, we would greatly appreciate it.          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the days go by, I learn more and more about the Finnish culture.  I know that we&amp;#39;ve lived here for almost 6 months now, but it continues to fascinate me.  For one, Finns come alive in the winter.  It&amp;#39;s like someone flipped a switch and everyone suddenly sprang to life.  When the days get down to 20 or below, you can see the smiles on their faces and hear the excitement in their voices.  &lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt;, they say, &lt;em&gt;a proper winter&lt;/em&gt;!  They use words like &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; to describe freezing temperatures.  I guess when winter takes up a majority of the year, you learn to embrace it.  No, they don&amp;#39;t embrace it, they &lt;em&gt;thrive&lt;/em&gt; off it.  All year they are waiting until the conditions are right for skiing, ice hockey, skating, ice fishing and all their other favorite winter activities.  They will tell you that the best sauna is the one when you can take a break from the heat to roll around in the snow (with no clothes on).  Now, I don&amp;#39;t want to make any over-generalizations about the entire population.  I have met a Finn that wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of winter, but I&amp;#39;d say those are few and far between.  Most of the time, you will find them enjoying the outdoors during these snow-covered days.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I don&amp;#39;t know if I quite thrive  off these northern temperatures yet, I have learned to embrace them.  I get to try so many things that I&amp;#39;ve never done before, like snowshoeing.  The other day a group of us went on a snowshoeing trek on and around a peninsula in Joensuu.  It took a little while to get used to waddling like a duck in the shoes, but soon it came naturally.  When we got to the lake our guides told us that we were going to cross by walking &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the lake.  I was a little hesitant at first because I didn&amp;#39;t totally trust that the water was frozen and would be able to hold my weight (plus 10 other people), but Finnish people usually know what they&amp;#39;re talking about when it comes to nature, so I went for it.  In the distance there were people snowmobiling, ice fishing and generally just enjoying an afternoon on the lake.  Being completely new to all this cold weather stuff, it was still kind of crazy to think about an entire lake being frozen.  Oh, and the sun peeked through the clouds for a couple of minutes.  That&amp;#39;s enough to lift my spirit for days.  It was a great way to spend an afternoon and when I got home I was exhausted.  While we were out there I didn&amp;#39;t feel like it was strenuous, but I guess 3 hours of snowshoeing will take it out of you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I know that everything I write about revolves around it being cold, but that pretty much sums up our lives right now.  &lt;em&gt;Cold and winter.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in the thick of winter over here.  Maybe that&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t posted in a while.  Not because we&amp;#39;ve been in hibernation (as I predicted in my last post), it has been quite the opposite actually, I think it&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;re really getting settled in now.  We have routines, schedules, and everything feels so normal now.  Like this is our home.  It no longer feels strange to be &lt;em&gt;carless&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, it was a weird feeling riding in a friend&amp;#39;s car the other weekend.  When the temperature gets up to the 20&amp;#39;s, we celebrate – I have actually said out loud, &lt;em&gt;it feels great outside today!&lt;/em&gt;  Never in my life would I have guessed those words would come out of my mouth, when there is snow on the ground and I am covered in three layers of clothing.  We cook every meal at home.  At first we were forced into this due to the lack of restaurants nearby (&lt;em&gt;or really just period&lt;/em&gt;), but now I&amp;#39;m really getting into it.  I look forward to making the next meal and am becoming quite territorial in the kitchen (I&amp;#39;m working on it).  We have great friends who we get to hang out with every week.  That really makes living anywhere enjoyable.  We share our different customs and holidays with each other, like a little international family.  Last weekend we celebrated Chinese New Year with some delicious, traditional dishes and the other day I learned how to make tortilla española, &lt;em&gt;Mmmm&lt;/em&gt;.  This weekend we celebrated Super Bowl Sunday (&lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s a holiday, right?&lt;/em&gt;).  Since we figured it wasn&amp;#39;t worth staying up to watch the game in the middle of the night, we postponed our viewing party.  We replayed the game,  even though we already knew the outcome (the commercials and halftime show are where it&amp;#39;s at).  And as expected, there was a continuous stream of questions about this barbaric sport Americans&amp;#39; lives revolve around for half of the year.   &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Hibernation Mode</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.20.2014/ice+swimming.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I go back and look at pictures or posts from, say, October or November, I laugh at the fact that I thought it was cold then.  &lt;em&gt;What a joke!&lt;/em&gt;  But I do think I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; realize what everyone meant when they said it was going to get much, much colder.  They meant that your breath would freeze your hair to your scarf, your fingers would burn, your nose would run to the extent that you could no longer feel it.  They meant that all you would crave is a hearty soup and some hot tea.  They meant that when you are forced to wear three layers (pants and jackets) to walk five minutes to the grocery store and when sleeping at school sounds like a better alternative than riding your bike home...that&amp;#39;s when you know it&amp;#39;s cold.  So in case you&amp;#39;re wondering, we will be in full hibernation mode for the next month and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.20.2014/meredith_scott_iceswimming.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this is going to contradict my previous statement about being in hibernation, but I guess I&amp;#39;m not really made for &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; hibernating, even in the coldest of weather.  Some friends invited us to go to the Polar Bear Club for some ice swimming over the weekend.  It was not an easy decision to make.  To start, because it would take us 30 minutes to get there, and that in itself sounds like torture in this weather.  Then we would voluntarily be subjecting ourselves to swimming in a hole cut out in the frozen river.  None of this really sounded inticing, except for the fact that it would get us out of our apartment to see other people.  &lt;em&gt;Soooo, we went.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes like this – sauna, swimming, sauna, repeat.  The idea is to get really hot in the sauna and then when you can&amp;#39;t take it any longer, you go cool off in the ice cold water.  The river was about 30 feet from the sauna.  I knew if it didn&amp;#39;t go straight in and I gave myself time to think, it wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen.  So when I got to the point when I couldn&amp;#39;t take the heat of the sauna any longer, I marched straight down to the river and immediately got in.  When my foot first hit the water, while walking down the ladder, I thought, &lt;em&gt;this is not so bad&lt;/em&gt;.  Then I lowered my entire body in and froze.  When the water pierced through to my bones, I wanted to scream.  But it won&amp;#39;t let you.  You are left with no voice.  Your adrenaline is the only thing that allows you to swim to the other ladder to expel yourself from the water as fast as humanly possible.  As soon as you get out, your voice comes back and you can finally say, &lt;em&gt;AHHHHH, that was sooo cold&lt;/em&gt;!!  Then for the next couple minutes you feel great.  Like you could stand outside, in the 7 degree weather, in your bathing suit, all day.  After that feeling wears off you realize you most definitely could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; stand out there any longer, much less all day, and you proceed to walk (probably closer to a run) back to the sauna.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I despise being cold, I can&amp;#39;t say that we&amp;#39;ll never do it again.  After all, it is just one of those things you do here during the wintertime.  And since we still have a good amount of winter ahead of us, we might as well embrace it.   &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Tornio and Kemi</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Meredith Scoggins&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.04.2014/yellow_building.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to and following New Year&amp;#39;s Eve we spent some time visiting two other cities in Lapland. Tornio is a small town that shares a border with the Swedish town of Haparanda. There wasn&amp;#39;t much to do in this small town, but it was kind of fun to walk right over to Sweden. Oh and a bonus to that is we went to a Swedish IKEA (&lt;em&gt;score&lt;/em&gt;). Most of the time IKEA is a nightmare because you generally go to buy one thing and you end up spending your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; day there due to the endless maze of a store. However, when you are in Tornio and you are wandering around trying to find something to do, preferably indoors, walking slowly through an IKEA isn&amp;#39;t half bad. (Plus we just wanted to say we&amp;#39;d been to an IKEA where it all began). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were there we also saw one of the oldest wooden churches in Finland, built in 1686, and went to a fake Tex-Mex restaurant. The person writing for Lonely Planet must not be from Texas because what we experienced was quite possibly the furthest thing from Tex-Mex. The jalapeño poppers weren&amp;#39;t even spicy.  &lt;em&gt;What is that??&lt;/em&gt; We actually had our first encounter with reindeer at this said Tex-Mex restaurant. After that we ate it another three times over the course of our trip in the form of, reindeer soup, reindeer burger and sautéed reindeer. I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that we enjoyed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stay in Kemi was a little more exciting (though it doesn&amp;#39;t even come close to the huskies).  Kemi is a port town that is known for its Snow Castle and Ice Breaker ship.  Unfortunately, neither of these things were open yet. We did get to see the beginnings of the Ice Castle though, which look pretty amazing. When it&amp;#39;s finished you can book a room inside the castle where it&amp;#39;s like -18 degrees Celsius.  Apparently it&amp;#39;s also a fairly popular spot for people to get married or honeymoon in the winter (if we had only known...). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things we did while we were there was walk on the frozen sea. There was a hole in the ice about 15 feet from shore that looked man-made, so we figured it had to be safe to walk on. It was a little risky, as we could have very well fallen through the ice and frozen to death, but fortunately we lived to tell about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our New Year&amp;#39;s Eve plans, as usual, were left to the last minute.  (We like to live on the edge).  Joensuu was a ghost town for the Christmas break and all flights, to just about everywhere, were jacked up for the holidays.  We knew we had to get out and do something or the darkness would swallow us up (&lt;em&gt;and because I get really antsy&lt;/em&gt;).  So after exhausting several options, we made the decision to travel to even more darkness and snow.  The bright side of this is that Santa would be there and he can brighten even the darkest of days, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;  Joulupukki, as the Finns call him, has a village that sits on the Arctic Circle, just north of Rovaniemi.  He has a post office where you can write yourself letters to be sent or have Santa himself send you one.  He has a workshop, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;, where you can buy many of the trinkets that his elves make.  There&amp;#39;s a Santa restaurant, café, and everything else you could imagine.  But the real reason that we went (don&amp;#39;t tell Santa) is for the huskies.  These are not your average huskies.  These puppies are masters of the sleigh.  We opted for an hour long sleigh ride. When we got to &amp;quot;Husky Park&amp;quot; we were informed that there was a snow problem and we may not be able to go (cue extreme disappointment).  But we soon found out that one of the women working there was going to take us out, WAY out, into the woods to a family that raises and trains the dogs for our ride.  We were super pumped.  Even more so when we learned that we would be &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; our own team of dogs.  I had imagined we would both just be along for the ride.  Little did we know Scott would be the leader (well other than the lead dogs, that is).  If that was the only thing we had done the entire time we were there, it would have been worth it.  The experience was unforgettable. The dogs were amazing.  We learned how they were trained and the different jobs each of them had on the team.  I was in awe of how good they were.  Oh, and then to top it off, we got to see some tiny husky babies. &lt;em&gt;I died&lt;/em&gt;. Just about the cutest things I&amp;#39;ve ever seen.  I apologize for the exessive amount of dog photos, but it could have been way worse.  And, I mean, if you don&amp;#39;t like pictures of dogs, &lt;em&gt;what&amp;#39;s wrong with you?&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it back to Kemi just before midnight and rang in the new year at the Old Gringo.  2013 was really good to us and I have a feeling 2014 is going to be a pretty great year too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After countless times passing through, we finally got to spend a little time in Helsinki.  We went straight from several days of luxury in Switzerland to two nights in the smallest apartment ever.  &lt;em&gt;And we thought our apartment was small.&lt;/em&gt; The bathroom in this place could barely fit one person at a time, literally.  You could brush your teeth, use the toilet and take a shower, all at the same time.  Luckily, we didn&amp;#39;t spend much time inside or I might have gone crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main objective for this trip was to visit as many Christmas markets as possible.  We hit up three and got a good fill of Christmas spirit.  Since Joensuu is not exactly a booming metropolis, we decided to get our Christmas shopping done in Helsinki.  All of the markets had various stands that sold homemade good and treats, but each one was a little bit different from the others.  Glögi, the Finnish version of mulled wine, is found everywhere around Christmas.  It&amp;#39;s traditionally served with almonds and raisins, in the actual drink.  I was initially hesitant about nuts in my drink, but it ends up being a nice little snack when you&amp;#39;re finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have really loved living in and visiting some of the smaller towns around Europe.  I think it has forced me to take a look around and appreciate the little things.  It&amp;#39;s nice to feel like we live in the middle of the forest.  Whenever I&amp;#39;m in the city center, I always stop and think real hard about anything else I need to do/get while I&amp;#39;m there because if I forget something, &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; it better be worth an hour long bike ride.  But I was raised in the city.  Deep down at my core, I&amp;#39;m a city girl.  So while we were in Helsinki, this surpressed city girl in me was doing cartwheels and flips.  I loved getting to try all the fun restaurants and cafés.  I loved that no matter where we were there was a store/restaurant/market/people around us.  We went to brunch for the first time since we&amp;#39;ve moved and it was deeeeelicious.  Oh how I miss overly priced food with fancy names.  My mouth is still watering just thinking about the mounds of food that we devoured.  It filled my compartment designated for big city things.  But truthfully, I missed Joensuu.  I was so happy to be back to our little apartment where the only thing we can hear is the loud sneezer that lives next door.  It&amp;#39;s nice to have some quiet time too.    &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Adelboden, Switzerland | Part II</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our exciting encounters with the mountains via snowboards, we spent our last full day exploring them on something a little more familiar.  There was a hiking trail near our hotel that took us to see some pretty mesmerizing views.  We first walked through the cutest neighborhood that I&amp;#39;m convinced we&amp;#39;ll live in some day (just like every other place we visit).  The houses all had names written on them and they all looked like they would have the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; fire place inside.  Towards the end of our hike it started to snow.  Much to our surprise, Switzerland was warmer than what we are used to in Finland, so the snow was a welcomed treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important things that we learned: everyone in Switzerland is trilingual (at least where we were), so we&amp;#39;ve really got to step up our game.  Also, I learned that you should be really sure that an egg is boiled before you try to crack it (&lt;em&gt;important life lessons&lt;/em&gt;).  Our first morning at breakfast I made it pretty clear to everyone around me that I had yet to learn this lesson.  I was really sure that this egg was boiled, &lt;em&gt;why would you serve an un-boiled egg???&lt;/em&gt;  So I tried to crack it.  It was really hard and wouldn&amp;#39;t crack on the table.  So I squeezed with all my might.  And then it cracked.  All. Over.  All over my shirt, all over my pants, all over the floor and all over my food.  It was quite a scene.  Needless to say, I avoided the eggs for the remainder of the trip.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all Switzerland was pretty amazing.  I could have stared at those mountains all day.  We were so lucky to get to spend our honeymoom amongst them.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea of the perfect honeymoon had always been a relaxing week on the beach, laying out in the scorching sun with little umbrellas in my drinks.  But since our recent move forced us pretty far north in the world, we felt like a warm beach was just too far away for a December trip, so we decided to embrace the winter.  Our minds were made up when Scott found an advertisement for a hotel wih an infinity pool looking out over the Swiss Alps - sign me up!  It really was everything we imagined (from the picture).  Skiing/snowboarding, a wintry hike and lots and lots of pool time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our journey began when our Finnish speaking skills failed us, yet again, and we were forced to walk to the train station in the snow/ice.  An hour pulling/pushing/dragging luagge through the ice qualified as my exercise for the rest of the year.  I was not a happy camper, starting from about three minutes in.  From there it took us a train, a plane, &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; train (with one transfer), and a bus to get us to this quaint Swiss town, but it was so worth it.  (I&amp;#39;d probably still be at the train station without Scott&amp;#39;s supreme navigating skills).  The people in Adelboden were so friendly and everyone spoke English (small victories).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect maybe skiing, with it being Scott&amp;#39;s first time and on some pretty narrow/steep slopes, was not the best honeymoon activity.  (The Swiss definition of &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; was a little different than ours).  We spent our first day with me trying really hard to be a good and patient snow board instructor and Scott not really feeling like I was succeeding at that.  Then I took a pretty serious tumble which left me partially crippled the rest of the trip.  At least these will be stories to entertain our children with some day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And some pictures along the way.)  Lately we&amp;#39;ve been transporting some abnormal things on our bikes.  Well mostly my bike because of it&amp;#39;s awesome abilities with the basket and all.  Riding with a rug in your basket or stools on the back are a little tricky in themselves, but what makes it even more challenging is manuvering through the snow with these things.  The day that beat them all (&lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt;) was the day we went to get the stools.  We decided that we needed a little more seating in our apartment and since we had people coming over the next day it seemed like the perfect time to buy some.  That day there just so happened to be a blizzard going on outside.  It seemed like as good of a day as any and the snow wasn&amp;#39;t going to be letting up any time soon, so we just bundled up and headed out.  At first the snow is kind of enchanting, but not too far in you start to feel like tiny frozen needles are piercing your eyeballs and there couldn&amp;#39;t be anything worse.  Except for the fact that it makes seeing almost impossible.  So we proceed to ride, eyes mostly shut, to the store.  At one point I told Scott that my eyelids would probably be frozen shut by the time we got there.  His response - just keep blinking.  After continuous blinking and an immense amount of pedaling, we arrived, both completely covered in snow but our eyes were still in tact.  An obvious progression of thought would be that our current situation makes for a perfect photo op, huh?  That&amp;#39;s what I thought.  And Scott, after the eye rolls and sighs, reluctantly obligied.  After the picture taking, walking back to my bike, I fell (&lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt;).  My first snow fall.  My feet completely came out from under me and my entire body hit the ground.  Bruised knee and all, that may have been the best part of the excursion (&lt;em&gt;after all, there is nothing funnier&lt;/em&gt;).  And although the journey was completely grueling and there was a moment where I prayed a helicopter would magically appear and pick us up, when we got home with those two stools it felt like we had just climbed Mt. Everest.  We made it!  Another check off the ole bucket list.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#39;re a little late, but since we don&amp;#39;t get Thanksgiving Day off over here we decided to postpone our Thanksgiving celebration until Sunday.  It was our first year not being with family, which of course was difficult, but we wanted to make it something fun and special anyway so we had our first Friendsgiving!  We invited over some of our good friends that we&amp;#39;ve made here in Finland, and since none of them are from the U.S. (therefore never having celebrated Thanksgiving) we had to do it right.  We spent the entire day Saturday and half of the day Sunday cooking as many traditional Thanksgiving dishes that we could manage.  Green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie...the works.  The only thing missing was the turkey.  I know, it&amp;#39;s a pretty key piece, but the only turkey we found in Joensuu was about a million dollars, so we opted out.  And even without the turkey and our families, it turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving.  Everyone left happy and full, which to me meant that it was a success!  This year we are so thankful for our friends and family back home and for the many new friends and memories that we&amp;#39;ve been able to make here.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was the best weekend ever.  So good that I was a little homesick for a couple of days after we got back to Finland.  Being around such wonderful friends and family for a week will do that to ya.  Especially when you come back to dead land and freezing cold weather.  (That day of 80+ in Dallas was such a tease.)  But we&amp;#39;re beginning to get back to life as usual again...this time as newlyweds (so weird).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now understand why they say that this time of the year is the hardest for the Finns.  It&amp;#39;s miserably cold everyday, only a couple bleak hours of sunlight and very little snow on the ground.  So you can&amp;#39;t really do much.  No summer activities because it&amp;#39;s too cold and no winter activities because there&amp;#39;s not enough snow.  Snow makes all the difference.  I&amp;#39;m amazed at how significantly brighter it is with all the white to reflect the light.  Plus, it just makes you want to get out and build a snowman.  So we&amp;#39;re hoping for a lot of snow in the next couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was our first time with friends since we&amp;#39;ve been back.  These friends live on the other side of Joensuu.  It took about 45 minutes, riding our bikes in the dark, to get there.  We don&amp;#39;t do that for just anyone.  But I&amp;#39;ve figured out a pretty baller way stay warm (relatively) while riding around.  You put on all the usual - jacket, gloves, boots, beenie, but the scarf is the key ingredient.  The scarf needs to be spread out, width-wise, completey and then wrapped around for the first time to cover your mouth and nose.  If the only thing visable is your eyes and you can feel your breath on your face, it&amp;#39;s on right.  Then wrap for the second time normally and tie the two ends tight enough so that no wind, snow or incredibly weak person could pry it off of you.  And then you&amp;#39;re ready.  You may feel like you you&amp;#39;re stuggling to breath or eating scarf fuzz, and you are, but that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s supposed to feel like.  I promise you although your scarf (and mouth area) may be wet from condensation afterwards, your face will thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friends, that we trekked across the world for, hosted a &amp;quot;Hamburg Night&amp;quot; to teach us all about their hometown in Germany.  Since Hamburg is a port city they made all the traditional sailor food for us to try.  Then we watched some videos about their beautiful city.  Definitely on my long list of places I want to visit now.  After spending a week at home it was nice to realize that we do have good friends here too.  &lt;/p&gt;

          <title>the dark days</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sunset&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/10.31.2013/sunset1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we “fell back” last weekend, it has become even more evident that we are losing sunlight quickly.  I’ve never been a fan of the darkness.  I was one of those kids that had to sleep with a nightlight (probably for too long).  I don’t like scary movies, in part because things are always popping out at you in dark places.  I don’t like to pump gas or take the trash out when it’s dark, simply because I have a bad feeling about the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been several mornings where the needle was just below E and I chose to risk it rather than stop and fill up in the dark. This is all a little disheartening, considering the fact that by the end of this year we will have less than five hours of sunlight (and by sunlight I mean, it’s overcast).  The single digit weather is not the part that scares me, it’s the sun, or lack thereof.  So we’ve been making a conscious effort to appreciate every drop of sunshine that we get.  But since I have no other choice than to face the reality of short, short days, I’ve started trying to learn to like the darkness too.  One of my favorite parts so far is the soft pink hue that kisses the sky right before the black curtain falls.  It never gets old.  Even if that means sunset at 4:00.We’re also trying out some new indoor hobbies.  I’m hesitant to say this, but I’m attempting to knit.  I question if I should tell anyone because, why is it so difficult??  I’ve started over three times already.  Maybe by summertime I’ll finish this scarf.  Some way or another we will survive this long winter.  One of those ways being planning a return of the sun party.          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all photos were taken before 4:30 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>ice hockey and everything cold</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;hockey&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/10.28.2013/IMG_4570.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;hockey fans&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/10.28.2013/IMG_4571.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;* die hard fans *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sauna, coffee, and ice hockey – that pretty much sums up priorities in Finland.  So on Saturday we went out to support Joensuu’s ice hockey team, the mighty Jokipojat.  There was a band and rowdy fans, which is exactly what I had hoped for.  We obviously brought with us some good mojo because they dominated.  I learned more about ice hockey than I ever knew existed.  Soon enough I’ll be the one standing by the band, yelling at the teams about what they’re doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, it’s cold here.  All the snow that I boasted about before is sadly gone now (thanks to the massive amount of rain that we’ve had), but I did get a chance to practice for the world’s slowest bike rider competition before it left.  Let me tell you, the conditions were just right for it.  There was a bunch of slush on the ground that day.  You’d think “Slush? How hard can it be to glide through some soft snow and water??”  That’s what I thought.  But when that slush is packed on top of a layer of thick, uneven ice, well that makes it a little more challenging.  It usually takes me 20 minutes to ride my bike to school.  On this particular day it took me at least twice as long (which is good statistics for slow competitions).  I was going barely faster than you could walk.  Going that slow on a bike is really a skill.  If you slow down even the slightest, there is a very good chance you will fall over.  But when you are riding on ice, if you speed up at all and hit the tiniest of bumps, there is also a very good chance you will fall over.  So I’m working with this balancing act for over 3 miles.  At one point I considered just collapsing on the snow in hope that someone would come along and rescue me.  But after 29 near wipe outs, I had outsmarted the ice and made it to school.  My feet were soaking wet from the giant puddles that I stepped in (to avoid a fall), but all was good because I made it to shelter.  Of course on my way home some nice snow fairy had come along and plowed all the snow on the sidewalks – so it was smooth sailing.  Compared to my previous riding time, I felt like I was flying down the road.  All the snow is gone now, so bike riding is back to normal.  But when the snow does come back, and it will, I just hope that the snow fairy comes back with it (and is considerate of when I need to go to class).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our weekend was filled with snowflakes, movies and chicken pot pie.  We had a pretty relaxing weekend over here, recovering from our travels, plus it just felt right to snuggle up under a blanket with all the snowing that is going on outside.  Thursday it was very much fall, then we woke up on Friday and it was winter.  Full force winter.  We basically just sat at the kitchen table all day marveling at the giant snowflakes and the fact that they just kept coming, trying to imagine what it’s going to be like in a couple months.  Time to dust off our cross country skis – I mean, maybe we should find some and learn how to use them.  We even got to practice a little snow bike riding (with helmets on, of course).  Just as I was fitting in with the cool kids with my no-handed riding (yep, you heard me, a whole 40 seconds)…well there will be none of that for the next four months.  Everyone keeps saying that this is only the beginning, that it’s only getting colder and so much snowier from here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, bring it on, snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tallinn, before I moved to Finland I had never heard of the likes of you and could not place your small country on a map. But I am sure glad we’ve been introduced now. What Joensuu is lacking in old world charm, you sure make up for it. With your pastel-colored medieval buildings and cozy cafés, you have won my heart. Your hidden nooks, used as viewing platforms, as the sky is painted pink in the evenings, well that’s just the cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost missing our train to Helsinki and then a quick ferry over the Baltic Sea, we’ve spent the past four days exploring the city of Tallinn. I highly recommend it. Old Town is pretty wonderful. Although it can be pretty touristy in some parts, I just couldn’t get enough of all the colorful buildings and cobblestone roads (though we’ve decided that’s why we are having feet/knee pains now). I don’t think that I’ve ever, purposefully, sat outside to eat a meal when it’s below 45 degrees, but that’s just what this town does to you. The outdoors call your name, the atmosphere is just too good to pass up. Amongst the beautiful churches and history of secret KGB headquarters, I think my favorite part of the trip was the visit to a certain giant slab of concrete. The concrete rooftop was built by the Soviets for the Olympic regatta of 1980. The rooftop in itself was not all that spectacular, but the view from the top was unbeatable. There was a little of Old Town to your left, the sea in front, and downtown Tallinn to your right. Sitting up top, watching the ferries come and go while the sun sets, is my idea of a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our trip was not without mishaps. For starters, we almost missed our train. I know I mentioned that earlier and you were picturing us running through the train station, hair blowing in the wind, jumping on the train just in time and then giggling at the close call. I wish. There we were waiting in line to print out our tickets, just 10 minutes before departure. Of course it was a long line and the machine was slow, that makes it all the more exciting. So our turn, with about 5 minutes left, and we can not figure out how to print the tickets. We ask the Finnish person behind us, no help. Our only other option is to go to the help desk, where the line is even longer. We both stand there in line, looking at the clock, then each other, panicking (well I’m panicking). Here are our options: wait in line and by the time we get to talk to someone it would be too late OR go get on the train and cross our fingers they won’t kick us off. It was a no brainer, we would take our chances with the train bouncers. I don’t think either of us took a breath as the ticket man was walking down our aisle. In my head I’m trying to formulate a backup plan if our email confirmation doesn’t work. Can I beg? Start crying? Offer him some of our trail mix we packed for a snack? Luckily I didn’t have to do any of those. The tickets worked. And for the other bloopers, well Scott almost ate it face first into the cobblestone walking down some stairs (I actually consider this a high point, since there is nothing funnier than falling…but I’m considering the general population’s views here). We also walked around in a circle at one point looking for a hotel, only to find out that we had literally been standing right in front of it to start with. These are the real life stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. We had our first Tex-Mex meal in over a month right here in Tallinn. Who knew they’d have their very own “Honky Tonk Texas Cantina”! Now I’m craving it again more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love nights around a bonfire.  They really bring people together.  There’s always lots of eating, laughing and entertaining stories to accompany them.  This weekend we definitely got our fair share of bonfire time.  Friday night we went with some of our new friends from Spain to build a bonfire and cook out near our apartment.  It was perfect.  The meeting of new people, eating of tortilla española and the gazing at stars was more than I could’ve asked for.The stars were pretty amazing.  They decorated the entire sky with twinkling light.  That’s one of the really special things about the middle of the forest at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had so much fun that we decided to do it again Saturday night!  We trekked over to the other side of town to celebrate a friend’s 30th birthday.  These little hidden treasure’s in Joensuu make you want to bonfire (yes, you can also use it as a verb) every night of the week.  We rented a little cabin by the lake where the only light inside came from the dimly lit fire and the candles sprinkled throughout.   We kept that fire going all night.  Even though that in itself would have been enough, the best part of the evening was getting to share a classic American tradition.  The s’more.  We had the great privilege of demonstrating how to roast a marshmallow (that we smuggled back from Texas) to the perfect golden brown state and transform that lonely marshmallow into a mouthwatering chocolate-graham cracker sandwich.  It was magical.  I’ll just say there were seconds involved. They’re not called s’mores for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wait is over.  Winter has arrived.  I don’t know if these people technically consider this winter, but this is definitely winter weather to me.  I had to break out the puffy coat, that’s when you know.  I think I wore it maybe three times last winter.  I always felt like “oh, it’s not that cold, I’m going to look ridiculous in this giant puffy coat.”  I think I want another one now…to wear on top of my current one.  The other day on my way home, it snowed.  Yes, snow flakes in SEPTEMBER!  It was brief, but there was no mistaking the plastering of ice to my face.  Of course at that point I’m already on my bike, gloves and hat on.  I really wanted to pull my giant fur hood on too, but for some reason my hands are incapable of doing anything productive once gloves are on.  They won’t button or zip anything, much less any more complex form of dexterity, like gripping and pulling…at the same time.  I learned this the hard way.  From now on, I will get completely put together before starting out on my trek.  Once I start there’s no stopping.  So I succumbed to the fact the hood is not going to work and continued my journey home.  I don’t know if there was anybody else on the sidewalk, I was in full survival mode.  Head down, gritting my teeth, pedaling as fast as my legs would let me.  (I was making some really serious faces…they help).  The small little inclines felt like Mt. Everest.  I didn’t know if I’d ever make it.  When I did finally get to my apartment, I had to fumble through keys, backpacks and bikes (why is everything more difficult when it’s cold?) before I got to shelter.  The weird thing is, once you’re inside and peel off the several layers of extra clothes, you think – that really wasn’t so bad.  But deep down you know that you’re just fooling yourself…it really is that bad.  Only 5 more months of this, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend Scott and I spent our days off at an organic farm outside of Joensuu.  Twice a year the owners of the farm have a volunteer weekend where people can come help harvest vegetables from their garden.  In return they provide a place to sleep and lots and lots of good, fresh food.  It was quite an experience.  Neither of us had ever done anything like it before.  We had so much fun (despite the fact that I couldn’t feel my hands half of the time), we 
will definitely be back again.  Our hosts, Niina and Pjotr, were such sweet people and taught us some quite interesting tidbits about farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had severals “firsts” over the weekend.  Our first time harvesting any kind of food, our first Finnish sauna, and Scott’s first, but surely not last, time sporting overalls.  He really rocked those overalls all weekend.  I think overalls automatically make you better at anything farming.  If nothing else, they sure make you look like you know what you’re doing.  We were such naturals at this whole harvesting thing that we plowed right on through the carrots and on to the beet roots and parsnips (with the help of about 25 other people).  I did have to stop for a couple dance breaks though.  That’s when you have to stand up and wiggle your fingers and toes to make sure that they’re all still there.  Being outside in 40 degree weather all day will make you question their existence.  But it was all worth it when we got to thaw out inside and inhale the delicious pumpkin-carrot soup and mounds of bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty excited to try out some new soups with our bag of veggies that made it home with us.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>making lists</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this list to fill in online, and seeing how making lists is on my top 10 favorite things to do, I thought I would give it a try.  Lists are so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;leaves&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.26.2013/_DSC1159.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making: do without a straightener.  There’s really no use with how wind blown my hair gets.
Cooking: salmon – pan seared salmon, salmon soup, salmon pie, you name it.
Drinking: café lattes every morning :)
Reading: articles about multiculturalism…really feeling like a student again.
Wanting: mexican food, BBQ, marshmallows.
Looking: for a pair of hiking pants.
Playing: like we know what we’re doing every time we go to the grocery store.  If you stare at the labels for just the right amount of time, it looks like you’re reading them.
Wasting: nothing in our refrigerator, living like true college students.
Sewing: nothing, but really wishing someone would sew me many pairs of mittens. And maybe a face mask while you’re at it.
Wishing: I could speak Finnish.
Enjoying: nature.
Waiting: for snowboarding season.
Liking: my bike with a basket on front.  That’s really all I ever wanted in life.
Wondering: when I’m going to have to break out the thermal underwear.  Very likely it could be tomorrow.
Loving: living abroad.
Hoping: to see Aurora Borealis in Joensuu.
Marveling: at people riding bikes no-handed, I seriously don’t get it.  It’s magical.
Needing: a microwave and a freezer, how do you live without??
Smelling: campfires.  Makes me jealous every time.
Wearing: hats, gloves, scarves, multiple jackets…anything to stay warm.
Following: the same path to school everyday.  It’s very likely that I’d get lost if I don’t.
Noticing: that somehow there is always one fly in our apartment, even though we killed one the day before.
Knowing: that the days are getting shorter and shorter.
Thinking: about our first trip in a couple of weeks.
Feeling: cold.  I think I spoke too soon about this amazing autumn weather.
Bookmarking: every place that I want to travel to.  Could be getting a little out of hand.
Opening: the couch…because it has storage!  Did I mention how awesome it is?
Giggling: at Scott being afraid of the giant birds.
Feeling: like November is coming really soon! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or as we say in Finland, autumn.  It does feel a little fancier when you call it – autumn.  I have always loved this season.  The leaves falling and changing colors.  Pumpkins everywhere – on porches, in pies, and in your latte.  The weather is getting just cool enough to where you want to spend every waking moment outside.  Well I don’t think I have ever really experienced a true fall.  Yes, leaves do fall and change colors and what not in Texas, but not like this.  In Texas it goes by so fast that if you blink you might just miss it.  (Although we do like to extend it a little longer with the carving of pumpkins, hanging of wreaths, and eating of candy corn – which I fully support).  Here I feel like it’s really autumn (minus the pumpkin lattes).  Every day I think the leaves get a little brighter yellow/orange/red.  And it definitely has that crisp autumn feel in the air (that’s what we call cold in Texas).  Everyone is starting to pull out their cold weather gear – hats, scarves, gloves, boots.  If you can find a nice spot to sit by the lake with some coffee, you’re golden.  I know that this isn’t going to last long, I can already hear the snowflakes whispering from the clouds, but I’m sure going to enjoy it while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>home is where the furniture is</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;boxes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/IMG_3968.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is…finally.  We have completely assembled furniture!!!  I can’t tell you how happy it makes me.  I have a new found appreciation for furniture.  I have always taken for granted the availability of seating in a home, but not anymore.  Every time I sit down on our new couch or work at our new desk, I think about how much I love having furniture.  And don’t even get me started on the bed.  A real bed WITH a mattress, ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;building&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/IMG_3962.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;building&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/building.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not easy.  If a couple can make it through building Ikea furniture together, without killing each other, they’re in it for the long haul.  That’s the true test.  When we first started I thought, “This will be fun! Just like building Legos (which is my favorite).”  And it was fun for the first couple minutes.  Then one of the parts didn’t want to do what it was supposed to do.  So we tried again.  And again.  Not working.  We finally gave up on the premise that Ikea had sent us the wrong part.  We later found out, when we chatted the Ikea lady online, that all we were missing was a little strength.  Thanks, Ikea lady.  I’ll be sure and order some of that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;couch&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/IMG_3975.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couch.  This beast is worth every grueling second of screwing in nails with the flimsiest of Ikea tools.  It is just the perfect size for our apartment, not too big but big enough to really get comfortable.  AND it’s a pull-out couch!! The ease at which this couch transforms into a bed is truly miraculous.  Like nothing you’ve ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;desk&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/_DSC0790.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the desk.  Oh there were pieces everywhere.  At least 60 of them – for this small little desk. On one of the steps we had to lay a big piece of the desk onto a bunch of nails sticking up from another piece.  There was this one nail.  It was not cooperating.  All I wanted was for it to fit into the desk nicely so that we could be done.  But I had to force it.  I was shoving the desk as hard as I could to get over that nail … right into my finger.There was blood and a lot of pain.  And then, just to spice up the day, I passed out.  So that kind of put a damper on things.  (Don’t worry, I DID get the piece into the nail, just had to take one for the team).  I was put on manual reading duty the rest of the day, not allowed near any sort of building material (just like I planned it…muhahaha).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the best story, on our adventure with Ikea, was when our second shipment came in.  I didn’t order all the pieces that we needed for our bed, so we had to place a second order for it (and we added a kitchen table and a lamp in there too, for good measure).  Apparently, this was not a home delivery, who knew? (Definitely not us).  So we had to ride about 1/2 mile to pick up our packages.  Mind you that we were picking up a kitchen table and Scott thought it was a good idea to take the bikes, but that’s beside the point.  We pick up this incredibly heavy, awkwardly shaped package and there is no way we can ride our bikes with it (told you).  So we proceed to walk, each carrying one side, back to our apartment.  Then it started to rain.  At this point I thought surely we were being punked.  And then it started raining harder.  1/2 mile and four flights of stairs never felt so long.  But we made it.  And on our way back to get our bikes, it was perfectly dry, sun shinning.  God really is the master jokster.           &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story, do not underestimate Ikea (like I did).  But in some ways it’s kind of awesome.  I truly feel like I could make any piece of furniture now with my bare hands, from a tree.  Ikea has taught me many lessons.  Maybe if this teaching thing doesn’t work out I’ll go into carpentry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my new favorite places.  This little tepee hut is just perfect.  It has a fire pit and fire wood all ready to go.  All it’s missing is some sticky marshmallows and melted chocolate.  I can see s’mores in my very near future.  The view is picturesque and the wooden tepee keeps you pretty warm inside.  We stayed a while, read a couple pages in our books and then took a few wrong turns on our way home.  Back to working and studying, I suppose.  But don’t worry, little tepee in the woods, we will be back soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I hope that this has made you want to visit here too because this was, in fact, a shameless ploy to attract visitors.)    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super pumped the morning of, but had a slight clothing crisis.  I don’t have real hiking clothes.  The closest thing I have is running pants and tennis shoes.  So that’s exactly what I wore.  When we got to the bus that was going to take us to Koli, I tried asking one of the leaders about the trip (since we didn’t sign up in advance).  We were having some communication issues, due to his lack of English and my lack of Finnish, so another lady going on the trip tried to help.  This was how it went.  Lady: “We are going on a hiking trip.”  Me: “Yes, I know, I was wondering if it would be okay if we joined.”  Lady: “Do you have clothes to wear?”  Me: “Um…what I’m wearing…”  She didn’t have to say any words after that, her face said it all.  It said, “You’ve got to be kidding me, what are those pants you’re wearing??”  Then the panic set in.  After Scott convinced me that I would be ok and wouldn’t be shunned from the group, we found a guy who spoke English and made our way onto the bus. (Side note: I will be buying real hiking pants soon.  Gotta fit in with the locals.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hike was amazing.  We went 16 kilometers (whatever that means) through Koli, stopping for a delicious sausage and kahvi lunch (everything tastes delicious after 10 km of hiking).  It felt like we were in a fairy tale.  I don’t know how to best describe it, but I’m going to try.  So in this fairy tale the characters are traveling though the forest.  Everything is green.  Like a really bright green.  There is soft moss everywhere.  When you walk over a patch of moss it feels like you’re on a trampoline.  The trees are so tall they look like they could touch the clouds.  There is dew on the ground.  That’s where we were.  In a movie.  Minus the fact that when you do walk over this luscious green moss, you may slip and try to play it off as a curtsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day with a traditional Finnish dinner of potato, carrot and ground beef soup.  There was also a sauna (of course), but unfortunately we forgot to bring our towels so we didn’t get to partake.  Overall, it was a pretty successful day with new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say that when they are homesick and are far away from their loved ones, they look up at the moon they somehow get this feeling that the world is a much smaller place.  Everyone all over is looking at the same moon which gives them comfort.  I’ve realized that squirrels are like that for me.  No matter where you are in the world, the chances are you will probably run across a squirrel.  Granted they are not the same squirrels that are hoping from country to country, but they are pretty darn similar.  The day we saw our first squirrel here, we both exclaimed, “Look, a squirrel!”  Like we had just seen the craziest animal.  But really I think it was like, “Look, they have squirrels here too, just like we do!”  Made me feel a little closer to home in that moment.  So next time you see a squirrel, think about us, and know that those little guys are in Finland too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as we are on the topic of animals though, let’s talk about the size of the animals here.  They are huge.  Like wildlife on steroids.  Instead of flying, the birds usually choose to hop around because – well, I’m sure their size makes flying a little more challenging.  But when they do take flight, it’s only about a foot or two off the ground.  Then the other day I was riding my bike home and I saw a mammoth of a bunny.  I mean by far the most gigantic bunny I have ever seen.  It was pretty dark though, so I thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Nope, the next day we saw one again!  It’s ridiculous.  Although I am poking fun at them now, I know that come wintertime, they will be the ones with the last laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>obligatory first day of school photo</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;First day of school&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.10.2013/_DSC0766.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;University of Eastern Finland&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.10.2013/IMG_3905.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is.  My first day of master&amp;#39;s school.  Since my mom is not in Finland, Scott has taken over her duties of picture taking (he is not nearly as good, mom).  But the picture lived up to its expectations just like all the other terribly awkward and unattractive first day photos…I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I rode The Viking (that’s what we’ve named her) to school, looking very collegiate with my fiancé’s backpack on.  So far I’ve learned that class scheduling in Finland is very different than what I’m used to in the states.  Most of the classes last for only 2-3 months.  So not all of them start on the first day, I have some that start in October or November.  And there’s generally no pattern to how the lessons are scheduled.  There’s no Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday classes.  There are just random days and times.  It’s been kind of confusing and somewhat difficult to organize in the beginning, but I’m thinking (hoping) that this is the hard part.  After scheduling everything I think it’ll be nice to have my classes so spread out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only had one class on my first day and everything went smoothly.  To start, we all introduced ourselves and said where we are from.  There are students from all over the world in my class – Namibia, Canada, Iran, China, Germany, Peru…the list goes on.  I’m so excited to get to know these people better and learn from their experiences in all their different countries.  I know that it will make for an interesting and rewarding two years.  Cheers to first days!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>furniture day</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We have gone four very looooooonng nights without any furniture.  Yes, that means we’ve been sleeping on the floor.  I started thinking about when I was younger and my parents would get up from the floor moaning and groaning about their legs/back/everything hurting and how I always thought that was so ridiculous.  I mean how is it even possible for your body to hurt from just sitting on the floor?? Let me tell you, it is possible.  My body now knows those pains all too well.  There is no comfortable position that you can get in when you are sleeping on the floor.  It was almost a relief when you woke up and realized that the night was over.  Finally, you can get up from the floor! And then the fireworks.  At least it sounded like that.  Popping happening all over the place.  So you can imagine the excitement on Furniture Day.  (That’s what we like to call it).  We woke up, wished each other a “Happy Furniture Day” and then the longest day of our lives commenced.  This is what it looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Looking out the window&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.07.2013/IMG_3961.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALL DAY.  Since every car in Finland has an engine that sounds exactly like a truck, we got up to look out the window approximately 152 times, only to be disappointed.  It was like waiting for Santa.  He never brings the presents while you’re awake, but you just can’t go to sleep.  So when we heard our door bell ring, it was like Christmas Day.  Except the two men at the door were holding a slip of paper instead of a bag full of presents.  Our first question – “do you speak English?”.  We got a very quick and direct “No.”.  Uh oh.  For the next couple seconds the four of us just looked at each other laughing (the kind of laughter when you have NO idea what to do next).  Then there were hand signals.  Box motions, fingers pointing down and….”Are – the – boxes – downstairs??”  Stares.  And more laughter.  Scott’s turn.  More charades.  Even more laughter.  I think we were laughing about the fact that there were two men at our door with something to tell us but no way to do it, but I’m not really even sure.  Then my genius, computer nerd fiancée pulled out google translate.  We typed in our question, handed them the computer and they typed back their response.  Thank you, technology.  Turns out they were just coming to tell us that the furniture would be delivered in 45 minutes.  We still don’t really know why they needed to tell us that.  But the important thing is 45 minutes later those same two men showed up with our 12 boxes of Ikea furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assembled furniture and Ikea mishaps, to be continued…&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>we're not in texas anymore</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past week or so that we’ve been living here, we’ve noticed several things that make it very clear we are not living in Texas anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  No stop signs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Crosswalk&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/IMG_3911.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very first day, as we were walking around the town, we noticed that there were not any hexagonal red signs with the word “Stop” in Finnish.  There actually weren’t any signs that looked like they could be stop signs.  Every time we came to an intersection the cars would just kind of slow down and one would go, then the other.  So I asked a native Finn.  She said that there was a sort of implied yield at every intersection that did not have a stop light. You were supposed to slow down and look to see if anyone else was coming, if not you could just go ahead.  I have yet to see an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  Bikes EVERYWHERE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Bikes&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/IMG_3919.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really something out of this world.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many bikes in one place.  I’m pretty sure there are more of them than cars.  On our long walks into town, there are bikes speeding past us the entire time.  And everyone rides them.  Young, old, and in between.  EXCITING NEWS: We got a bike!! Well I got a bike.  There was only one available and it was on the smaller side, so it fit me better.  It looks pretty rough, but it rides great.  You would not believe how much faster we can get places now!  Since we only have one now Scott rode it home and I sat on the back.  It was a sight to see I’m sure.  If only there were pictures…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  Blondes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blondes not pictured due to my lack of paparazzi skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were waiting in the airport terminal for our flight on FinnAir, they were everywhere.  I have never seen so many natural blondes in one place before.  It was crazy.  Since we’ve been in Joensuu though we’ve realized that we may have gotten a skewed picture of Finland in the airport.  There are definitely a lot more natural blondes than in Texas, but it’s not the entire population.  I can stop putting lemon juice in my hair now.  Joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  No friendly smiles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Smiles&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/_DSC0718.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a completely natural reaction for me to smile at people when they walk past me or when I make eye contact with them.  I may even go so far as to say hello, even though I have never seen them before in my life.  Not here.  I haven’t been able to bring myself to stop trying yet, but I am not getting the reactions that I want.  Everyone is extremely nice and helpful, they are just reserved and do not go out of their way to say hello or give you a friendly smile.  But I almost feel rude if I just continue looking straight ahead and don’t even acknowledge their presence.  I will persevere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.  Shower/bathroom area&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Shower area&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.05.2013/IMG_3906.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the first taste of this in our hotel room when we arrived in Helsinki.  I hoped and prayed and crossed my fingers that the bathroom in our apartment would be different.  But when we got to our next hotel in Joensuu and the bathroom was the same, I lost hope.  So let me explain, there is nothing separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom.  Meaning, when you take a shower the water is not confined to the shower area, it has the freedom to go all over the bathroom if it so pleases.  I (and I really mean Scott would be doing it) had plans of building some sort of barricade on the floor to let the water know where it’s supposed to stay, but luckily the one in our bathroom really hasn’t bothered me so much.  The water seems to be tamer or the layout of our bathroom is better, but it’s working for us so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we realize there’s no place like Texas, we’re learning to love our new home here.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>on the way to school</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick look at some of the things that we see on our way to school (or in Scott’s case, the coffee house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berries
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

Swimming holes (we think)

          <title>our new apartment</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Corridor and Bedroom&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.03.2013/corridor_bedroom.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Kitchen&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.03.2013/kitchen.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been so happy to have such a tiny dorm room with no dishwasher, no living room, and no furniture.   The day started out pretty solid when we took a walk to the river and spent some time contemplating what life would be like in the snow.  But when we went to the leasing office and they told us that the keys were ready to our flat, well that just put it over the top.  Although in our last few days in this hotel, I’ve become quite fond of it, I am ready to get to a space where we can actually walk around.  A place where our six bags do not take up the entirety of the room.  So that afternoon my Finnish friend, who has been a life saver, loaded up our bags in her car to take to the apartment.  After two trips from the hotel and six trips up the stairs to the fourth floor, we were sweating and out of breath, but we were home.  We surveyed the place and decided that it definitely felt bigger than 540 sq ft.  Hurray!!  It is definitely a worn dorm room, but other than that, it’s pretty nice.  We walked to the super market down the street from our place to gets some essentials and cleaning supplies to make it feel just a little bit more like home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;River and Forest&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.03.2013/lake_forest.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;River&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.03.2013/IMG_3886.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The super market.  Well that’s another story.  It seems like every time we have interaction with another human being these days we’re doing something ridiculous and embarrassing.  First of all, the walk to the super market is awesome.  It’s basically a walk through the forest with super tall trees surrounding you.  (Talk to me again when I have to make this walk in the snow).  So the actual shopping experience was pretty normal.  We gathered everything we needed, making an educated guess on some things since the labels were in Finnish, and went to check out.  It started off just like you would think any checking out experience would (minus the fact that she greeted me with “Hyva”, but I mummbled something back so it was all good).  As she is scanning all of our items she puts them on the conveyer belt and they slide down to the end…where no one is bagging them.  First I’m thinking “ok, that’s fine, I’m sure we just grab some bags over here and do it ourselves”.  So I look around for said bags and there are none.  I ask Scott where the bags are and he has no idea.  I’m looking around at the other people checking out to see what they are doing, but I can’t get a good look.  Plus, by this point all of our items are at the end of the conveyer belt, unbagged and there is a line forming behind us.  Scott wants us to just grab everything in our hands and carry all 30 items the 5 minute walk home.  That really didn’t sound fun to me so I decide to ask the cashier.  I started off by asking her IN FINNISH if she speaks English.  Success!  She does.  Then I was like, “Um…so….bagsss??”.  She laughed and pointed to the front of the check out line where they kept all the bags.  As we are rapidly bagging everything, so the next person in line could start, we felt relief that the next time we go to the super market we’re going to look like locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day:  Back at the super market, looking like pros…however, turns out that we stole (accidentally) like 7 bags.  Apparently you are supposed to pay for those.  Next time we’ll get it right, I know it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>our new little town</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Joensuu&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/08.31.2013/Joensuu.jpg&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first full day in Joensuu we gave ourselves a little tour of our new town.  First, we took a look around the super market.  You will not guess what they had!!  Tex-Mex brand galore! Tortillas, salsa and guacamole in a jar!  We’re going to be alright after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop, the shopping center aka the mall.  You know I had to check it out.  We just did some window shopping, but then we saw Marimekko.  (Side note: Marimekko is everywhere.  Scarfs, pillows, backpacks, even our cups and napkins on the plane.)  So we went in to see what all the fuss was about.  That’s when it happened.  It was bound to happen sooner or later, but I was not prepared for it.  The saleswoman looked straight at me and said “hjgdhsajkdslhs”.  At least that’s what I heard.  I froze.  Not froze in the sense I couldn’t remember what to say in Finnish so I responded in English (or even Spanish), no I just froze completely.  My body stopped moving and I just looked at her like a deer in headlights.  No words coming out of my mouth.  Finally, after what seemed like some veeeerrrry long seconds, she realized I wasn’t going to respond and said “Do you speak English?”  So many celebrations going on in my head – I know those words!!  My lips unfroze and said “Yes!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way back to our hotel we stopped at a coffee shop.  You know the rumor is that Finns drink more coffee than people anywhere else in the world.  Well it’s true.  I mean, AlLL DAY LONG.  On the train to Joensuu, it’s 4 pm and people are buying coffee like it’s going out of style.  At dinner.  Walking around the city mid-day.  Everywhere, all the time.  We’ve decided that the Finnish motto is “It’s 8 am somewhere”.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>moving to finland</title>
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;At DFW&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/08.30.2013/IMG_3804.JPG&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of advice: When traveling, do not take more suitcases than you have hands.  Reasons: 1) You will look like the stereotypical American with too much stuff, 2) You will stand up for a four hour train ride because your luggage doesn’t fit in the overhead bins, 3) You will take two trips from the train station to your hotel to transport all your bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know in the movies when someone is chasing someone else in the train station?  The pursuer is on one side of the train tracks and the pursuee is on the other.  Then the train comes.  The pursuer stares at the other side, where the pursuee was standing, and as soon as the train passes the person has vanished.  Well when we were moving all of our six bags and two backpacks across to the other side of the train tracks, that was the scenario.  Since it is impossible to carry more bags than you have hands, Scott is taking two bags at a time down the stairs, through the underground tunnel, and up the other stairs to our platform.  My job is to watch the two bags that he leaves there when he comes back to get two more.  Then a train comes.  In my head I am yelling at Scott to walk faster through the tunnel.  My heart is racing.  I am sending daggers with my eyes through the train to the spot where the bags were, in hopes that will deter them from disappearing, like on the movies.  And it worked.  The bags were magically still in the same spot when the train passed.  Lesson learned: pack light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, there are a lot of trees in Finland.  I mean like more than I’ve ever seen before.  I did some serious tree-staring on the train ride to Joensuu.&lt;/p&gt;
