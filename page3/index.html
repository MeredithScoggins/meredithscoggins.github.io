<p>After we left the lively town of Dingle, our next stop as we headed south was Cahersiveen.  We didn’t even know how to pronounce the name of the town, much less what to do once we got there.  Fortunately, the owner of our Bed &amp; Breakfast gave us the low down on everything we needed to know once we got there.  Cahersiveen is a super tiny town, but off its coast is Valentia Island and a bit further into the Atlantic is Skellig Michael.  Valentia Island has an interesting history (it was the place where the first transatlantic cables operated between Europe and North America), along with its diverse landscape, which make it a great place to explore.  We decided to tackle the island one morning before heading on to our last stop of the trip.  When we started our drive it was so foggy that we could hardly see 10 feet in front of us, which didn’t bode well for all the amazing views we had been promised.  We pressed on anyway.  We stopped at all the different points of interest on our map and eventually got to the lighthouse.  We parked the car and made the trek down to the peninsula.  When we got close we could see there was a sign hanging on the closed gates.  <em>Not a good sign.</em>  We finally got close enough to read that the lighthouse was closed due to weather.  The sky was dark, the fog was still holding up and the wind was howling pretty fiercely.  Although I was slightly bummed about not getting to go into the lighthouse, being that close to the wild, angry ocean somehow felt even more exciting.  I don’t know what it is, but being outside when the weather is so intense (when you’re somewhat prepared for it) gives me this thrilling rush.  It feels like I’m pushing myself up to the edge and looking down a steep cliff.  Then just when I feel like I’ve stayed there long enough to feel a small sense of accomplishment (or uncomfortableness), I walk away to a warm, dry car.  </p>

<p>When we finished our sightseeing around the island, we took the scenic route to Cork.  I’m not kidding when I say this route was the most scenic of all the scenic routes.  It was also quite possibly one of the most windy routes I’ve ever taken (<em>and I thought I had grown out of that car sickness thing</em>).   Even during the times when I had to lay my head down and close my eyes, I forced myself to peek out the window every now and then because I couldn’t risk missing any of the jaw-dropping views.  I made a mental note of some of the places that I wanted to come back and visit someday (Killarney National Park, I&#39;m talking to you).  I mean, I knew Ireland had some pretty places, but it was so much more than I expected.  There’s so many places to see and things to do that I didn’t want it to end.  But I told myself that I wasn&#39;t saying goodbye forever, and someday I’d be back for more.                    </p>

<p>After our week in England, we popped over to Ireland for the next week.  At this point in the summer I had done so much planning for our previous trips that this one kind of got put on the back burner.  I booked places to stay and had an idea of some of the things we could do in each town, but it wasn’t put through my typically extensive planning regimen.  Lucky for us, Ireland turned out to be the perfect place for that type of minimal planning.  </p>

<p>On our first day, we drove out to the town of Loophead for lunch and planned to make a stop at the lighthouse.  Like many of the towns along the west coast, Loophead is a small town with more sheep than people (I don’t know if that’s actually true, but it sure seemed like it).  You would think that would make it really easy to find your way around.  <em>Wrong.</em>  Unless you happen upon two little Irish children with fiery red hair and the most adorable accents you’ve ever heard, riding their bikes along the same dirt street that you are driving on, you might be driving in circles for a while.  We stopped to ask the kids for directions and I fully expected them to have no idea what we were talking about, much less be able to give us perfect directions to the restaurant, but that’s just what they did.  <em>Ye can take yer first left at the end of the street, den ye will see the main street and the restaurant will be on yer right.</em>  It was too much.  I couldn’t stop talking about how ridiculously cute they were.  </p>

<p>The Irish coast is completely stunning.  Everywhere you look there are the most dramatic cliffs, mountains and fields.  One of my favorite moments was when we were driving along the coast in Dingle and we stumbled upon a beach tucked into the bottom of a cliff.  I desperately wanted to get down onto the beach so I called for a pitstop.  The view was unreal.  Waves crashing in front of you, huge rocks creating secret alcoves scattered around, and then gazing upward, were sheep and cattle grazing at the edge of the cliff.  The wind was blowing so hard that it was almost hard to see at times, but that made it all the more thrilling.  Scott braved the water while the rest of us held on to our rain coats and shouted to be heard over the roaring winds.  We didn&#39;t stay for long, but the time we spent on that little beach is something that I&#39;ll never forget.    </p>

<p>Everything’s funnier in a British accent, don’t you think?  I’m that person that turns around and giggles every time someone says “Cheers!”, even when it’s the 274th time I’ve heard it in a week.  But you know what <em>really</em> gets me…little British children.  I mean, can you think of anything cuter than a three year-old telling his <em>mummy</em> that he thinks going to the zoo this afternoon is going to be <em>quite lovely</em>?  That’s because there isn’t.  Nothing tops that.  Our days were filled with practicing of our own British accents every chance we got, which was <em>quite often</em>.  I’m not sure if everyone else got quite the kick out of our constant impersonations as we did though.  </p>

<p>There is so much history in London, and all of England, you could be there for months and still not see everything.  We tried to see all the major tourist sites, while making sure we penciled in plently of time to explore slowly (ie., our weekend in Brighton).  It was so fun wandering around London with my dad on his first trip to Europe; we had some good quailty father-daughter time.  I think this trip may have hooked him.  He&#39;ll be back to Europe again.    </p>

<p>On another note, I’ve decided that I’m going to start adding some “tips” to our travel posts.  They’ll be some of our favorite things that we did/ate while we were there and maybe some helpful suggestions, so that others can learn from our mistakes.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>LONDON TRAVEL TIPS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stay</strong><br>
We stayed in a neighborhood called Hackney, which is in East London.  The area is more “up and coming”, meaning there’s some nicer areas right next to some not-so-nice areas.  Hackney has some really nice restaurants and shops and it’s cheaper than staying in the center of London, but if you’re planning on going into the center everyday then I’d probably stay a little closer.  The Tube has easy and convenient connections pretty much everywhere, but it can add some time to your day if you’re going far, especially during rush hours. </p>

<p><strong>Best EATS</strong><br>
<u>The Clapton Hart</u>: Really good pub food and atmosphere.  They only have a few things on their menu, but they’re all spot on.  I recommend the Bean Burger. We went here twice during the 5 days we were in London, if that tells you anything.</span></p>

<p><u>Yum Yum Thai Restaurant</u>: We had SO much food here and it was all delicious.  But maybe don’t order a Seafood sampler and an entrée each, unless you’re <em>really</em> hungry, then you should, because your stomach and tastebuds will thank you.  </p>

<p><u>El Olivo</u>: My dad says these were the best tapas that he’s ever had.  I don’t know how many times he’s actually had tapas though, so I’m going to vouch for them too.  They were darn good.  And what are tapas without sangria? <em>Get it.</em>  </p>

<p><strong>Favorite Thing(s) We Did</strong><br>
<u>The Parliament House</u>: I’ll admit, I thought this tour was going to be really lame (I’m pretty particular about tours), but it was actually very interesting.  We did the audio tour and I’d say it was definitely worth it.  It was very well organized and not very crowded (compared to some of the other touristy places). We learned a lot about the history and current happenings of the Parliment.    </p>

<p><u>Football Match</u>: If you&#39;re into football (soccer) and have a chance, go to a match. It&#39;s quite the experience, the hardcore/rowdy fans really get you into the spirit and you get a little taste of the strong culture around the sport.  </p>

<p><strong>More Tips</strong><br>
Remember that England likes to be a little unique and has different outlets than the rest of Europe, so make sure you check that you have the right adapters when you go (i.e., be smarter than us).  </p>

<p><br>
<strong>BRIGHTON TRAVEL TIPS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stay</strong><br>
<u>Regency Lansdowne Guest House</u>: Mike, the owner of the B&amp;B, was so incredibly kind and accommodating and prepared a yummy breakfast every morning.  The rooms were very nice and Mike provides you with everything you need…even outlet adapters, for those, <em>ahem</em>, forgetful travelers.  The house is actually located in Hove, but Brighton and Hove are neighboring towns situated right next to each other.  We walked from our B&amp;B in Hove all the way to the Brighton Pier (and we weren’t huffing and puffing when we got there). An extra plus is that the beach is just a 2 minute walk down the street! You can see it from the steps of the house.</p>

<p><strong>Best EATS</strong><br>
<u>Archipelagos Taverna</u>: Some good Greek food can be found here.  I got a Greek salad and an order of baked white beans.  I know, it doesn’t sound all that enticing, but my husband and dad practically ate all the beans off my plate, that’s how good they were.  </p>

<p><strong>Favorite Thing(s) We Did</strong><br>
Take a walk along the beach! We started in Hove (from our B&amp;B) and strolled down the shore, stopping to listen to outdoor karaoke and watch the street performers, until we got to Brighton Pier.  Then we cut back up through the town, winding through the side streets decorated with millions of shops.  Seriously, <em>millions</em>.  Then, come evening time, buy yourself a bottle of wine and some sandwich fixin’s and make your way back out to the beach and enjoy the sunset over the water.  It’s all about the beach here.         </p>

<p><strong>More Tips</strong><br>
If you are looking for a weekend escape, this is the place for you.  There’s not many <em>sites</em> to see, but there’s plenty of restaurants, shopping and shoreline waiting for you.  We didn’t experience the nightlife, but it looked and sounded like it was pretty lively, at least on the weekends.  Cute little town overall.  </p>

<p>So here’s the thing, the picture above, it’s actually from the first time that I went to Copenhagen with my mom.  This time around we were still traveling with our friends, Kevin and Debrán, and well, the weather was not all that great.  It was pretty chilly and it rained practically the entire time we were there.  That’s not to say that we didn’t have a great time, it’s just that I didn’t really take any pictures.  This time around it wasn’t so much about the sites we saw or even the food we ate (although it was still amazing), the best part of our time in Copenhagen actually revolved around a foosball table.  I’ve never really been a big fan of foosball, probably because I’ve never been very good at it, and it just seemed kind of dumb (probably because I never won).  But Kevin and Debrán wound up with a foosball table in their flat, so after dinner our first night, we decided to give it a try.  After Debrán effortlessly scored the first goal, like she’d been secretly training all her life, we couldn’t stop playing.  I don’t know if it was the dreary weather, or the fact that by game two we all had been nicknamed according to our style of play, or maybe it was the super competitiveness coming out in all of us.  Anyway, we were all hooked.  I’m sure we woke up the neighbors with our fits of laughter and the occasional scream at our teammates, the tiny plastic ones.  So that’s what happened every night, a foosball rematch, until one of the teams barely squeaked out a win (<em>oh, it’s not over yet</em>).  And it was the best ending to a really great trip.     </p>

<p>The first day we got to Bergen it was pouring rain and pretty darn chilly.  Scott and I came completely unprepared, with no rain jackets and barely any warm clothing.  We had gotten used to the nice warm weather we’d been having way too easily and forgotten that these places require jackets and scarfs for most of the year.  Our traveling buddies, however, came far more prepared than we did.  Which shouldn’t have come as a surprise since they’re always far more prepared than us (<em>that’s why we’re friends</em>).  We made the decision that we weren’t going to let the rain get in our way of seeing this Norwegian city though.  After all, Bergen has over 230 days of annual rainfall (<em>we found out once we were there</em>).  So we trudged out into the city with wet clothes and smiles on our faces (sort of).  One of the things that our host warned us about (but definitely not the most shocking) was the high cost of eating at restaurants in Norway.  Most locals cook at home to keep costs down and rarely eat out.  So we followed her advice and went to the fish market to buy our dinner.  After gathering all the supplies to make dinner, we took the short cut back to our place.  This is the other <em>shocking</em> thing that our host warned us about.  Across the street from the apartment that we were renting, was a well known drug park.  Everyone knew it, even the police, and apparently they had made the decision to leave all the druggies be, as long as they kept to the park.  We were warned that we would see all kinds of <em>crrrrazy</em> stuff going on in the park.  <em>It’s like your own private show, right outside your window,</em> she explained, laughing. We all laughed with her.  Then when she left we looked at each other, completely stunned.  Not exactly the kind of welcoming we had imagined.  But then we laughed again, for real this time, and took the long way to the market.  Well on the way back it was raining, like really raining, and we were carrying heavy bags of groceries.  So we opted for the short cut through the park, after all, she assured us it was completely safe.  <em>Don’t look at them, walk fast, but not too fast, act like we’re talking</em>…these were the things we reminded each other of before embarking on the 2 minute walk through the park.  <em>Ok, we’re almost there.  Which way is it?  I think it’s this way.  Wait, maybe it’s that way.  Just keep walking!</em> - as we basically slid down a steep muddy hill, which was clearly not the path to our apartment.   But looking lost in the middle of the drug park was not an option, so we acted as if we needed a good challenge.  Sidewalks bore us.  We successfully made it back, after what seemed like 2 <em>very long</em> minutes.  We earned some serious bravery points for that, I’m sure.  I mean, no big deal, we’re hardcore.                     </p>

<p>After our first day there, mother nature pleasantly surprised us with lots of sun and very minimal rain.  I think that I can speak for the group when I say that the best part of our stay in Bergen was the day we took the ferry through the Sognefjord.  To get to the fjord we took a train and a bus through some of the most stunning landscapes I’ve ever seen.  The kind that that make it on postcards.  It was unreal.  But the ferry through the fjord was definitely the cherry on top.  The greenest greens and the bluest blues you’ve ever seen.  Waterfalls every time you turned your head.  Mountains coming straight out of the river, on both sides, decorated every so often with a tiny cluster of houses.  Better than the pictures.  It was, without a doubt, worth <em>several</em> walks through the drug park.                     </p>
