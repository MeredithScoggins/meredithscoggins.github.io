<p>This past weekend Scott and I spent our days off at an organic farm outside of Joensuu.  Twice a year the owners of the farm have a volunteer weekend where people can come help harvest vegetables from their garden.  In return they provide a place to sleep and lots and lots of good, fresh food.  It was quite an experience.  Neither of us had ever done anything like it before.  We had so much fun (despite the fact that I couldn’t feel my hands half of the time), we 
will definitely be back again.  Our hosts, Niina and Pjotr, were such sweet people and taught us some quite interesting tidbits about farming.</p>

<p>We also had severals “firsts” over the weekend.  Our first time harvesting any kind of food, our first Finnish sauna, and Scott’s first, but surely not last, time sporting overalls.  He really rocked those overalls all weekend.  I think overalls automatically make you better at anything farming.  If nothing else, they sure make you look like you know what you’re doing.  We were such naturals at this whole harvesting thing that we plowed right on through the carrots and on to the beet roots and parsnips (with the help of about 25 other people).  I did have to stop for a couple dance breaks though.  That’s when you have to stand up and wiggle your fingers and toes to make sure that they’re all still there.  Being outside in 40 degree weather all day will make you question their existence.  But it was all worth it when we got to thaw out inside and inhale the delicious pumpkin-carrot soup and mounds of bread.</p>

<p>I’m pretty excited to try out some new soups with our bag of veggies that made it home with us.</p>

        <p>I found this list to fill in online, and seeing how making lists is on my top 10 favorite things to do, I thought I would give it a try.  Lists are so satisfying.</p>

<p>Making: do without a straightener.  There’s really no use with how wind blown my hair gets.
Cooking: salmon – pan seared salmon, salmon soup, salmon pie, you name it.
Drinking: café lattes every morning :)
Reading: articles about multiculturalism…really feeling like a student again.
Wanting: mexican food, BBQ, marshmallows.
Looking: for a pair of hiking pants.
Playing: like we know what we’re doing every time we go to the grocery store.  If you stare at the labels for just the right amount of time, it looks like you’re reading them.
Wasting: nothing in our refrigerator, living like true college students.
Sewing: nothing, but really wishing someone would sew me many pairs of mittens. And maybe a face mask while you’re at it.
Wishing: I could speak Finnish.
Enjoying: nature.
Waiting: for snowboarding season.
Liking: my bike with a basket on front.  That’s really all I ever wanted in life.
Wondering: when I’m going to have to break out the thermal underwear.  Very likely it could be tomorrow.
Loving: living abroad.
Hoping: to see Aurora Borealis in Joensuu.
Marveling: at people riding bikes no-handed, I seriously don’t get it.  It’s magical.
Needing: a microwave and a freezer, how do you live without??
Smelling: campfires.  Makes me jealous every time.
Wearing: hats, gloves, scarves, multiple jackets…anything to stay warm.
Following: the same path to school everyday.  It’s very likely that I’d get lost if I don’t.
Noticing: that somehow there is always one fly in our apartment, even though we killed one the day before.
Knowing: that the days are getting shorter and shorter.
Thinking: about our first trip in a couple of weeks.
Feeling: cold.  I think I spoke too soon about this amazing autumn weather.
Bookmarking: every place that I want to travel to.  Could be getting a little out of hand.
Opening: the couch…because it has storage!  Did I mention how awesome it is?
Giggling: at Scott being afraid of the giant birds.
Feeling: like November is coming really soon! :)</p>

<p>Or as we say in Finland, autumn.  It does feel a little fancier when you call it – autumn.  I have always loved this season.  The leaves falling and changing colors.  Pumpkins everywhere – on porches, in pies, and in your latte.  The weather is getting just cool enough to where you want to spend every waking moment outside.  Well I don’t think I have ever really experienced a true fall.  Yes, leaves do fall and change colors and what not in Texas, but not like this.  In Texas it goes by so fast that if you blink you might just miss it.  (Although we do like to extend it a little longer with the carving of pumpkins, hanging of wreaths, and eating of candy corn – which I fully support).  Here I feel like it’s really autumn (minus the pumpkin lattes).  Every day I think the leaves get a little brighter yellow/orange/red.  And it definitely has that crisp autumn feel in the air (that’s what we call cold in Texas).  Everyone is starting to pull out their cold weather gear – hats, scarves, gloves, boots.  If you can find a nice spot to sit by the lake with some coffee, you’re golden.  I know that this isn’t going to last long, I can already hear the snowflakes whispering from the clouds, but I’m sure going to enjoy it while it lasts.</p>

        <p>Here it is…finally.  We have completely assembled furniture!!!  I can’t tell you how happy it makes me.  I have a new found appreciation for furniture.  I have always taken for granted the availability of seating in a home, but not anymore.  Every time I sit down on our new couch or work at our new desk, I think about how much I love having furniture.  And don’t even get me started on the bed.  A real bed WITH a mattress, ludicrous.</p>

<p>It was not easy.  If a couple can make it through building Ikea furniture together, without killing each other, they’re in it for the long haul.  That’s the true test.  When we first started I thought, “This will be fun! Just like building Legos (which is my favorite).”  And it was fun for the first couple minutes.  Then one of the parts didn’t want to do what it was supposed to do.  So we tried again.  And again.  Not working.  We finally gave up on the premise that Ikea had sent us the wrong part.  We later found out, when we chatted the Ikea lady online, that all we were missing was a little strength.  Thanks, Ikea lady.  I’ll be sure and order some of that next time.</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="couch" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/IMG_3975.JPG" width="970"/>
</div>

<p>The couch.  This beast is worth every grueling second of screwing in nails with the flimsiest of Ikea tools.  It is just the perfect size for our apartment, not too big but big enough to really get comfortable.  AND it’s a pull-out couch!! The ease at which this couch transforms into a bed is truly miraculous.  Like nothing you’ve ever seen before.</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="desk" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/_DSC0790.JPG" width="970"/>
</div>

<p>Then there’s the desk.  Oh there were pieces everywhere.  At least 60 of them – for this small little desk. On one of the steps we had to lay a big piece of the desk onto a bunch of nails sticking up from another piece.  There was this one nail.  It was not cooperating.  All I wanted was for it to fit into the desk nicely so that we could be done.  But I had to force it.  I was shoving the desk as hard as I could to get over that nail … right into my finger.There was blood and a lot of pain.  And then, just to spice up the day, I passed out.  So that kind of put a damper on things.  (Don’t worry, I DID get the piece into the nail, just had to take one for the team).  I was put on manual reading duty the rest of the day, not allowed near any sort of building material (just like I planned it…muhahaha).</p>

<p>But perhaps the best story, on our adventure with Ikea, was when our second shipment came in.  I didn’t order all the pieces that we needed for our bed, so we had to place a second order for it (and we added a kitchen table and a lamp in there too, for good measure).  Apparently, this was not a home delivery, who knew? (Definitely not us).  So we had to ride about 1/2 mile to pick up our packages.  Mind you that we were picking up a kitchen table and Scott thought it was a good idea to take the bikes, but that’s beside the point.  We pick up this incredibly heavy, awkwardly shaped package and there is no way we can ride our bikes with it (told you).  So we proceed to walk, each carrying one side, back to our apartment.  Then it started to rain.  At this point I thought surely we were being punked.  And then it started raining harder.  1/2 mile and four flights of stairs never felt so long.  But we made it.  And on our way back to get our bikes, it was perfectly dry, sun shinning.  God really is the master jokster.           </p>

<p>Moral of the story, do not underestimate Ikea (like I did).  But in some ways it’s kind of awesome.  I truly feel like I could make any piece of furniture now with my bare hands, from a tree.  Ikea has taught me many lessons.  Maybe if this teaching thing doesn’t work out I’ll go into carpentry.</p>

<p>One of my new favorite places.  This little tepee hut is just perfect.  It has a fire pit and fire wood all ready to go.  All it’s missing is some sticky marshmallows and melted chocolate.  I can see s’mores in my very near future.  The view is picturesque and the wooden tepee keeps you pretty warm inside.  We stayed a while, read a couple pages in our books and then took a few wrong turns on our way home.  Back to working and studying, I suppose.  But don’t worry, little tepee in the woods, we will be back soon enough.</p>

<p>(I hope that this has made you want to visit here too because this was, in fact, a shameless ploy to attract visitors.)    </p>
