        <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.20.2014/ice+swimming.jpg" width="970" /> <p>When I go back and look at pictures or posts from, say, October or November, I laugh at the fact that I thought it was cold then.  <em>What a joke!</em>  But I do think I <em>finally</em> realize what everyone meant when they said it was going to get much, much colder.  They meant that your breath would freeze your hair to your scarf, your fingers would burn, your nose would run to the extent that you could no longer feel it.  They meant that all you would crave is a hearty soup and some hot tea.  They meant that when you are forced to wear three layers (pants and jackets) to walk five minutes to the grocery store and when sleeping at school sounds like a better alternative than riding your bike home...that's when you know it's cold.  So in case you're wondering, we will be in full hibernation mode for the next month and a half.</p>

        <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.04.2014/yellow_building.jpg" width="970" /> <p>Leading up to and following New Year's Eve we spent some time visiting two other cities in Lapland. Tornio is a small town that shares a border with the Swedish town of Haparanda. There wasn't much to do in this small town, but it was kind of fun to walk right over to Sweden. Oh and a bonus to that is we went to a Swedish IKEA (<em>score</em>). Most of the time IKEA is a nightmare because you generally go to buy one thing and you end up spending your <em>entire</em> day there due to the endless maze of a store. However, when you are in Tornio and you are wandering around trying to find something to do, preferably indoors, walking slowly through an IKEA isn't half bad. (Plus we just wanted to say we'd been to an IKEA where it all began). </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.04.2014/yellow_building.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.04.2014/tornio_church.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.04.2014/scott_icehole.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.04.2014/meredith_scott_icehole.jpg" width="970" /></div>

        <img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/01.03.2014/village.jpg" width="970" /> <p> Our New Year's Eve plans, as usual, were left to the last minute.  (We like to live on the edge).  Joensuu was a ghost town for the Christmas break and all flights, to just about everywhere, were jacked up for the holidays.  We knew we had to get out and do something or the darkness would swallow us up (<em>and because I get really antsy</em>).  So after exhausting several options, we made the decision to travel to even more darkness and snow.

We went straight from several days of luxury in Switzerland to two nights in the smallest apartment ever.  <em>And we thought our apartment was small.</em> The bathroom in this place could barely fit one person at a time, literally.  You could brush your teeth, use the toilet and take a shower, all at the same time.  Luckily, we didn't spend much time inside or I might have gone crazy.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/12.27.2013/blackandwhite_building.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/12.27.2013/church_scott.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/12.27.2013/christmasmarket.jpg" width="970" /></div>

There was a hiking trail near our hotel that took us to see some pretty mesmerizing views.  We first walked through the cutest neighborhood that I'm convinced we'll live in some day (just like every other place we visit).  The houses all had names written on them and they all looked like they would have the <em>perfect</em> fire place inside. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/12.24.2013/hikingtrails.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/12.24.2013/scotthiking.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/12.24.2013/houses.jpg" width="970" /></div>
