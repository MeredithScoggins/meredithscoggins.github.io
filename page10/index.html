        <p>Here it is…finally.  We have completely assembled furniture!!!  I can’t tell you how happy it makes me.  I have a new found appreciation for furniture.  I have always taken for granted the availability of seating in a home, but not anymore.  Every time I sit down on our new couch or work at our new desk, I think about how much I love having furniture.  And don’t even get me started on the bed.  A real bed WITH a mattress, ludicrous.</p>

<div class="image">

</div>

<p>It was not easy.  If a couple can make it through building Ikea furniture together, without killing each other, they’re in it for the long haul.  That’s the true test.  When we first started I thought, “This will be fun! Just like building Legos (which is my favorite).”  And it was fun for the first couple minutes.  Then one of the parts didn’t want to do what it was supposed to do.  So we tried again.  And again.  Not working.  We finally gave up on the premise that Ikea had sent us the wrong part.  We later found out, when we chatted the Ikea lady online, that all we were missing was a little strength.  Thanks, Ikea lady.  I’ll be sure and order some of that next time.</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="couch" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/IMG_3975.JPG" width="970"/>
</div>

<p>The couch.  This beast is worth every grueling second of screwing in nails with the flimsiest of Ikea tools.  It is just the perfect size for our apartment, not too big but big enough to really get comfortable.  AND it’s a pull-out couch!! The ease at which this couch transforms into a bed is truly miraculous.  Like nothing you’ve ever seen before.</p>

<div class="image">
<img alt="desk" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/09.20.2013/_DSC0790.JPG" width="970"/>
</div>

<p>Then there’s the desk.  Oh there were pieces everywhere.  At least 60 of them – for this small little desk. On one of the steps we had to lay a big piece of the desk onto a bunch of nails sticking up from another piece.  There was this one nail.  It was not cooperating.  All I wanted was for it to fit into the desk nicely so that we could be done.  But I had to force it.  I was shoving the desk as hard as I could to get over that nail … right into my finger.There was blood and a lot of pain.  And then, just to spice up the day, I passed out.  So that kind of put a damper on things.  (Don’t worry, I DID get the piece into the nail, just had to take one for the team).  I was put on manual reading duty the rest of the day, not allowed near any sort of building material (just like I planned it…muhahaha).</p>

<p>But perhaps the best story, on our adventure with Ikea, was when our second shipment came in.  I didn’t order all the pieces that we needed for our bed, so we had to place a second order for it (and we added a kitchen table and a lamp in there too, for good measure).  Apparently, this was not a home delivery, who knew? (Definitely not us).  So we had to ride about 1/2 mile to pick up our packages.  Mind you that we were picking up a kitchen table and Scott thought it was a good idea to take the bikes, but that’s beside the point.  We pick up this incredibly heavy, awkwardly shaped package and there is no way we can ride our bikes with it (told you).  So we proceed to walk, each carrying one side, back to our apartment.  Then it started to rain.  At this point I thought surely we were being punked.  And then it started raining harder.  1/2 mile and four flights of stairs never felt so long.  But we made it.  And on our way back to get our bikes, it was perfectly dry, sun shinning.  God really is the master jokster.           </p>

<p>Moral of the story, do not underestimate Ikea (like I did).  But in some ways it’s kind of awesome.  I truly feel like I could make any piece of furniture now with my bare hands, from a tree.  Ikea has taught me many lessons.  Maybe if this teaching thing doesn’t work out I’ll go into carpentry.</p>

<p>One of my new favorite places.  This little tepee hut is just perfect.  It has a fire pit and fire wood all ready to go.  All it’s missing is some sticky marshmallows and melted chocolate.  I can see s’mores in my very near future.  The view is picturesque and the wooden tepee keeps you pretty warm inside.  We stayed a while, read a couple pages in our books and then took a few wrong turns on our way home.  Back to working and studying, I suppose.  But don’t worry, little tepee in the woods, we will be back soon enough.</p>

<p>(I hope that this has made you want to visit here too because this was, in fact, a shameless ploy to attract visitors.)    </p>

<p>I was super pumped the morning of, but had a slight clothing crisis.  I don’t have real hiking clothes.  The closest thing I have is running pants and tennis shoes.  So that’s exactly what I wore.  When we got to the bus that was going to take us to Koli, I tried asking one of the leaders about the trip (since we didn’t sign up in advance).  We were having some communication issues, due to his lack of English and my lack of Finnish, so another lady going on the trip tried to help.  This was how it went.  Lady: “We are going on a hiking trip.”  Me: “Yes, I know, I was wondering if it would be okay if we joined.”  Lady: “Do you have clothes to wear?”  Me: “Um…what I’m wearing…”  She didn’t have to say any words after that, her face said it all.  It said, “You’ve got to be kidding me, what are those pants you’re wearing??”  Then the panic set in.  After Scott convinced me that I would be ok and wouldn’t be shunned from the group, we found a guy who spoke English and made our way onto the bus. (Side note: I will be buying real hiking pants soon.  Gotta fit in with the locals.)</p>

<p>The hike was amazing.  We went 16 kilometers (whatever that means) through Koli, stopping for a delicious sausage and kahvi lunch (everything tastes delicious after 10 km of hiking).  It felt like we were in a fairy tale.  I don’t know how to best describe it, but I’m going to try.  So in this fairy tale the characters are traveling though the forest.  Everything is green.  Like a really bright green.  There is soft moss everywhere.  When you walk over a patch of moss it feels like you’re on a trampoline.  The trees are so tall they look like they could touch the clouds.  There is dew on the ground.  That’s where we were.  In a movie.  Minus the fact that when you do walk over this luscious green moss, you may slip and try to play it off as a curtsy.</p>

<p>We ended the day with a traditional Finnish dinner of potato, carrot and ground beef soup.  There was also a sauna (of course), but unfortunately we forgot to bring our towels so we didn’t get to partake.  Overall, it was a pretty successful day with new friends.</p>

<p>People say that when they are homesick and are far away from their loved ones, they look up at the moon they somehow get this feeling that the world is a much smaller place.  Everyone all over is looking at the same moon which gives them comfort.  I’ve realized that squirrels are like that for me.  No matter where you are in the world, the chances are you will probably run across a squirrel.  Granted they are not the same squirrels that are hoping from country to country, but they are pretty darn similar.  The day we saw our first squirrel here, we both exclaimed, “Look, a squirrel!”  Like we had just seen the craziest animal.  But really I think it was like, “Look, they have squirrels here too, just like we do!”  Made me feel a little closer to home in that moment.  So next time you see a squirrel, think about us, and know that those little guys are in Finland too.</p>

<p>As long as we are on the topic of animals though, let’s talk about the size of the animals here.  They are huge.  Like wildlife on steroids.  Instead of flying, the birds usually choose to hop around because – well, I’m sure their size makes flying a little more challenging.  But when they do take flight, it’s only about a foot or two off the ground.  Then the other day I was riding my bike home and I saw a mammoth of a bunny.  I mean by far the most gigantic bunny I have ever seen.  It was pretty dark though, so I thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Nope, the next day we saw one again!  It’s ridiculous.  Although I am poking fun at them now, I know that come wintertime, they will be the ones with the last laugh.</p>

<p>Here it is.  My first day of masters school.  Since my mom is not in Finland, Scott has taken over her duties of picture taking (he is not nearly as good, mom).  But the picture lived up to its expectations just like all the other terribly awkward and unattractive first day photos…I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I rode The Viking (that’s what we’ve named her) to school, looking very collegiate with my fiancé’s backpack on.  So far I’ve learned that class scheduling in Finland is very different than what I’m used to in the states.  Most of the classes last for only 2-3 months.  So not all of them start on the first day, I have some that start in October or November.  And there’s generally no pattern to how the lessons are scheduled.  There’s no Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday classes.  There are just random days and times.  It’s been kind of confusing and somewhat difficult to organize in the beginning, but I’m thinking (hoping) that this is the hard part.  After scheduling everything I think it’ll be nice to have my classes so spread out.</p>

<p>I only had one class on my first day and everything went smoothly.  To start, we all introduced ourselves and said where we are from.  There are students from all over the world in my class – Namibia, Canada, Iran, China, Germany, Peru…the list goes on.  I’m so excited to get to know these people better and learn from their experiences in all their different countries.  I know that it will make for an interesting and rewarding two years.  Cheers to first days!</p>
