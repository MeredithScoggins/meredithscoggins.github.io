<p>I love nights around a bonfire.  They really bring people together.  There’s always lots of eating, laughing and entertaining stories to accompany them.  This weekend we definitely got our fair share of bonfire time.  Friday night we went with some of our new friends from Spain to build a bonfire and cook out near our apartment.  It was perfect.  The meeting of new people, eating of tortilla española and the gazing at stars was more than I could’ve asked for.The stars were pretty amazing.  They decorated the entire sky with twinkling light.  That’s one of the really special things about the middle of the forest at night.</p>

<p>We had so much fun that we decided to do it again Saturday night!  We trekked over to the other side of town to celebrate a friend’s 30th birthday.  These little hidden treasure’s in Joensuu make you want to bonfire (yes, you can also use it as a verb) every night of the week.  We rented a little cabin by the lake where the only light inside came from the dimly lit fire and the candles sprinkled throughout.   We kept that fire going all night.  Even though that in itself would have been enough, the best part of the evening was getting to share a classic American tradition.  The s’more.  We had the great privilege of demonstrating how to roast a marshmallow (that we smuggled back from Texas) to the perfect golden brown state and transform that lonely marshmallow into a mouthwatering chocolate-graham cracker sandwich.  It was magical.  I’ll just say there were seconds involved. They’re not called s’mores for nothing.</p>

<p>The wait is over.  Winter has arrived.  I don’t know if these people technically consider this winter, but this is definitely winter weather to me.  I had to break out the puffy coat, that’s when you know.  I think I wore it maybe three times last winter.  I always felt like “oh, it’s not that cold, I’m going to look ridiculous in this giant puffy coat.”  I think I want another one now…to wear on top of my current one.  The other day on my way home, it snowed.  Yes, snow flakes in SEPTEMBER!  It was brief, but there was no mistaking the plastering of ice to my face.  Of course at that point I’m already on my bike, gloves and hat on.  I really wanted to pull my giant fur hood on too, but for some reason my hands are incapable of doing anything productive once gloves are on.  They won’t button or zip anything, much less any more complex form of dexterity, like gripping and pulling…at the same time.  I learned this the hard way.  From now on, I will get completely put together before starting out on my trek.  Once I start there’s no stopping.  So I succumbed to the fact the hood is not going to work and continued my journey home.  I don’t know if there was anybody else on the sidewalk, I was in full survival mode.  Head down, gritting my teeth, pedaling as fast as my legs would let me.  (I was making some really serious faces…they help).  The small little inclines felt like Mt. Everest.  I didn’t know if I’d ever make it.  When I did finally get to my apartment, I had to fumble through keys, backpacks and bikes (why is everything more difficult when it’s cold?) before I got to shelter.  The weird thing is, once you’re inside and peel off the several layers of extra clothes, you think – that really wasn’t so bad.  But deep down you know that you’re just fooling yourself…it really is that bad.  Only 5 more months of this, right?</p>

<p>This past weekend Scott and I spent our days off at an organic farm outside of Joensuu.  Twice a year the owners of the farm have a volunteer weekend where people can come help harvest vegetables from their garden.  In return they provide a place to sleep and lots and lots of good, fresh food.  It was quite an experience.  Neither of us had ever done anything like it before.  We had so much fun (despite the fact that I couldn’t feel my hands half of the time), we 
will definitely be back again.  Our hosts, Niina and Pjotr, were such sweet people and taught us some quite interesting tidbits about farming.</p>

<p>We also had severals “firsts” over the weekend.  Our first time harvesting any kind of food, our first Finnish sauna, and Scott’s first, but surely not last, time sporting overalls.  He really rocked those overalls all weekend.  I think overalls automatically make you better at anything farming.  If nothing else, they sure make you look like you know what you’re doing.  We were such naturals at this whole harvesting thing that we plowed right on through the carrots and on to the beet roots and parsnips (with the help of about 25 other people).  I did have to stop for a couple dance breaks though.  That’s when you have to stand up and wiggle your fingers and toes to make sure that they’re all still there.  Being outside in 40 degree weather all day will make you question their existence.  But it was all worth it when we got to thaw out inside and inhale the delicious pumpkin-carrot soup and mounds of bread.</p>

<p>I’m pretty excited to try out some new soups with our bag of veggies that made it home with us.</p>

        <p>I found this list to fill in online, and seeing how making lists is on my top 10 favorite things to do, I thought I would give it a try.  Lists are so satisfying.</p>

<p>Making: do without a straightener.  There’s really no use with how wind blown my hair gets.
Cooking: salmon – pan seared salmon, salmon soup, salmon pie, you name it.
Drinking: café lattes every morning :)
Reading: articles about multiculturalism…really feeling like a student again.
Wanting: mexican food, BBQ, marshmallows.
Looking: for a pair of hiking pants.
Playing: like we know what we’re doing every time we go to the grocery store.  If you stare at the labels for just the right amount of time, it looks like you’re reading them.
Wasting: nothing in our refrigerator, living like true college students.
Sewing: nothing, but really wishing someone would sew me many pairs of mittens. And maybe a face mask while you’re at it.
Wishing: I could speak Finnish.
Enjoying: nature.
Waiting: for snowboarding season.
Liking: my bike with a basket on front.  That’s really all I ever wanted in life.
Wondering: when I’m going to have to break out the thermal underwear.  Very likely it could be tomorrow.
Loving: living abroad.
Hoping: to see Aurora Borealis in Joensuu.
Marveling: at people riding bikes no-handed, I seriously don’t get it.  It’s magical.
Needing: a microwave and a freezer, how do you live without??
Smelling: campfires.  Makes me jealous every time.
Wearing: hats, gloves, scarves, multiple jackets…anything to stay warm.
Following: the same path to school everyday.  It’s very likely that I’d get lost if I don’t.
Noticing: that somehow there is always one fly in our apartment, even though we killed one the day before.
Knowing: that the days are getting shorter and shorter.
Thinking: about our first trip in a couple of weeks.
Feeling: cold.  I think I spoke too soon about this amazing autumn weather.
Bookmarking: every place that I want to travel to.  Could be getting a little out of hand.
Opening: the couch…because it has storage!  Did I mention how awesome it is?
Giggling: at Scott being afraid of the giant birds.
Feeling: like November is coming really soon! :)</p>

<p>Or as we say in Finland, autumn.  It does feel a little fancier when you call it – autumn.  I have always loved this season.  The leaves falling and changing colors.  Pumpkins everywhere – on porches, in pies, and in your latte.  The weather is getting just cool enough to where you want to spend every waking moment outside.  Well I don’t think I have ever really experienced a true fall.  Yes, leaves do fall and change colors and what not in Texas, but not like this.  In Texas it goes by so fast that if you blink you might just miss it.  (Although we do like to extend it a little longer with the carving of pumpkins, hanging of wreaths, and eating of candy corn – which I fully support).  Here I feel like it’s really autumn (minus the pumpkin lattes).  Every day I think the leaves get a little brighter yellow/orange/red.  And it definitely has that crisp autumn feel in the air (that’s what we call cold in Texas).  Everyone is starting to pull out their cold weather gear – hats, scarves, gloves, boots.  If you can find a nice spot to sit by the lake with some coffee, you’re golden.  I know that this isn’t going to last long, I can already hear the snowflakes whispering from the clouds, but I’m sure going to enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
