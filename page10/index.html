<p>One of my new favorite places.  This little tepee hut is just perfect.  It has a fire pit and fire wood all ready to go.  All it’s missing is some sticky marshmallows and melted chocolate.  I can see s’mores in my very near future.  The view is picturesque and the wooden tepee keeps you pretty warm inside.  We stayed a while, read a couple pages in our books and then took a few wrong turns on our way home.  Back to working and studying, I suppose.  But don’t worry, little tepee in the woods, we will be back soon enough.</p>

<p>(I hope that this has made you want to visit here too because this was, in fact, a shameless ploy to attract visitors.)    </p>

<p>I was super pumped the morning of, but had a slight clothing crisis.  I don’t have real hiking clothes.  The closest thing I have is running pants and tennis shoes.  So that’s exactly what I wore.  When we got to the bus that was going to take us to Koli, I tried asking one of the leaders about the trip (since we didn’t sign up in advance).  We were having some communication issues, due to his lack of English and my lack of Finnish, so another lady going on the trip tried to help.  This was how it went.  Lady: “We are going on a hiking trip.”  Me: “Yes, I know, I was wondering if it would be okay if we joined.”  Lady: “Do you have clothes to wear?”  Me: “Um…what I’m wearing…”  She didn’t have to say any words after that, her face said it all.  It said, “You’ve got to be kidding me, what are those pants you’re wearing??”  Then the panic set in.  After Scott convinced me that I would be ok and wouldn’t be shunned from the group, we found a guy who spoke English and made our way onto the bus. (Side note: I will be buying real hiking pants soon.  Gotta fit in with the locals.)</p>

<p>The hike was amazing.  We went 16 kilometers (whatever that means) through Koli, stopping for a delicious sausage and kahvi lunch (everything tastes delicious after 10 km of hiking).  It felt like we were in a fairy tale.  I don’t know how to best describe it, but I’m going to try.  So in this fairy tale the characters are traveling though the forest.  Everything is green.  Like a really bright green.  There is soft moss everywhere.  When you walk over a patch of moss it feels like you’re on a trampoline.  The trees are so tall they look like they could touch the clouds.  There is dew on the ground.  That’s where we were.  In a movie.  Minus the fact that when you do walk over this luscious green moss, you may slip and try to play it off as a curtsy.</p>

<p>We ended the day with a traditional Finnish dinner of potato, carrot and ground beef soup.  There was also a sauna (of course), but unfortunately we forgot to bring our towels so we didn’t get to partake.  Overall, it was a pretty successful day with new friends.</p>

<p>People say that when they are homesick and are far away from their loved ones, they look up at the moon they somehow get this feeling that the world is a much smaller place.  Everyone all over is looking at the same moon which gives them comfort.  I’ve realized that squirrels are like that for me.  No matter where you are in the world, the chances are you will probably run across a squirrel.  Granted they are not the same squirrels that are hoping from country to country, but they are pretty darn similar.  The day we saw our first squirrel here, we both exclaimed, “Look, a squirrel!”  Like we had just seen the craziest animal.  But really I think it was like, “Look, they have squirrels here too, just like we do!”  Made me feel a little closer to home in that moment.  So next time you see a squirrel, think about us, and know that those little guys are in Finland too.</p>

<p>As long as we are on the topic of animals though, let’s talk about the size of the animals here.  They are huge.  Like wildlife on steroids.  Instead of flying, the birds usually choose to hop around because – well, I’m sure their size makes flying a little more challenging.  But when they do take flight, it’s only about a foot or two off the ground.  Then the other day I was riding my bike home and I saw a mammoth of a bunny.  I mean by far the most gigantic bunny I have ever seen.  It was pretty dark though, so I thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Nope, the next day we saw one again!  It’s ridiculous.  Although I am poking fun at them now, I know that come wintertime, they will be the ones with the last laugh.</p>

<p>Here it is.  My first day of masters school.  Since my mom is not in Finland, Scott has taken over her duties of picture taking (he is not nearly as good, mom).  But the picture lived up to its expectations just like all the other terribly awkward and unattractive first day photos…I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I rode The Viking (that’s what we’ve named her) to school, looking very collegiate with my fiancé’s backpack on.  So far I’ve learned that class scheduling in Finland is very different than what I’m used to in the states.  Most of the classes last for only 2-3 months.  So not all of them start on the first day, I have some that start in October or November.  And there’s generally no pattern to how the lessons are scheduled.  There’s no Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday classes.  There are just random days and times.  It’s been kind of confusing and somewhat difficult to organize in the beginning, but I’m thinking (hoping) that this is the hard part.  After scheduling everything I think it’ll be nice to have my classes so spread out.</p>

<p>I only had one class on my first day and everything went smoothly.  To start, we all introduced ourselves and said where we are from.  There are students from all over the world in my class – Namibia, Canada, Iran, China, Germany, Peru…the list goes on.  I’m so excited to get to know these people better and learn from their experiences in all their different countries.  I know that it will make for an interesting and rewarding two years.  Cheers to first days!</p>

        <p>We have gone four very looooooonng nights without any furniture.  Yes, that means we’ve been sleeping on the floor.  I started thinking about when I was younger and my parents would get up from the floor moaning and groaning about their legs/back/everything hurting and how I always thought that was so ridiculous.  I mean how is it even possible for your body to hurt from just sitting on the floor?? Let me tell you, it is possible.  My body now knows those pains all too well.  There is no comfortable position that you can get in when you are sleeping on the floor.  It was almost a relief when you woke up and realized that the night was over.  Finally, you can get up from the floor! And then the fireworks.  At least it sounded like that.  Popping happening all over the place.  So you can imagine the excitement on Furniture Day.  (That’s what we like to call it).  We woke up, wished each other a “Happy Furniture Day” and then the longest day of our lives commenced.  This is what it looked like.</p>

<p>ALL DAY.  Since every car in Finland has an engine that sounds exactly like a truck, we got up to look out the window approximately 152 times, only to be disappointed.  It was like waiting for Santa.  He never brings the presents while you’re awake, but you just can’t go to sleep.  So when we heard our door bell ring, it was like Christmas Day.  Except the two men at the door were holding a slip of paper instead of a bag full of presents.  Our first question – “do you speak English?”.  We got a very quick and direct “No.”.  Uh oh.  For the next couple seconds the four of us just looked at each other laughing (the kind of laughter when you have NO idea what to do next).  Then there were hand signals.  Box motions, fingers pointing down and….”Are – the – boxes – downstairs??”  Stares.  And more laughter.  Scott’s turn.  More charades.  Even more laughter.  I think we were laughing about the fact that there were two men at our door with something to tell us but no way to do it, but I’m not really even sure.  Then my genius, computer nerd fiancée pulled out google translate.  We typed in our question, handed them the computer and they typed back their response.  Thank you, technology.  Turns out they were just coming to tell us that the furniture would be delivered in 45 minutes.  We still don’t really know why they needed to tell us that.  But the important thing is 45 minutes later those same two men showed up with our 12 boxes of Ikea furniture.</p>
