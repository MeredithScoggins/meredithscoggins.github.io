<br></p>

<p>In the south of Chile, in between two charming town, sits a lake with jaw-dropping views from every angle.  Jagged mountains serve as the primary backdrop to the typically glass-like water.  Though the towering volcano with smoke looming around its peak can easily steal the show with the overwhelming sense of awe it provokes.  This lake just so happens to be located two blocks from the cabin we’re currently calling home.</p>

</div>
<br></p>

<p>Though the lake remains fairly quiet during the colder months, the presently deserted kiosks, the empty black sand beach, and the single brave kayaker give us glimpses of the lively scenes that flood its shores in the summer.  While we dream of those warmer days when we can dip our feet into the pristine water, we will not let the chilly air keep us from enjoying walks along the shore, reveling in its staggering beauty.  </p>

</div></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>There is something incredibly calming about the sight of water that seems to put everything into perspective and quiets the day-to-day anxieties that we all experience.  The massive mountains seem to tell us that our worries are not nearly as big as they feel, and encourage moments of reflection which help us re-evaluate our priorities. Though the busyness of our lives can often times discourage us from taking the time to partake in simple things that don’t produce a tangible product, such as taking a walk, I always feel more grounded after I have allowed myself to do those things.  </p>

<p>As I write this and once again realize how fortunate we are to live so close to this little oasis in southern Chile, I hope to take advantage of all that this lake offers as much as possible during our time here.     </p>

        <br><img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="travel" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2016.04.15+Why+do+we+travel%3F/travel.jpg" /><br><br><p> I’m naturally a pretty quiet person (though some might say otherwise).  I love going out and spending time with my friends, but I also love quiet time at home.  My entire life I’ve been labeled “the quiet one”.  When I was younger I frequently got asked, <em>“Do you speak?”</em> by people I didn’t know well.  I started to really hate that about 	myself.  I felt like it was a hurdle I had to overcome if I ever wanted to be successful.  Then the summer before my senior year in college I decided to study abroad in Spain.  I intentionally did not go through my university; instead I went with an outside program where I wouldn’t know anyone.  In some ways it was a test.  <em>Can you do this?  What will you do when you have no one to hide behind?  How will you get by without your safety net of friends?</em>  Needless to say, it was quite the shock at first.  But I adapted, and eventually it became a whole lot easier.  I passed the test.  I think I knew all along that I would, but I needed that extra push.  Without even realizing it in the moment, I was living out the mantra that I’ve been trying to live by recently - <em>If something scares you, do it</em>.  The fear that comes from the unknown is something that I want to continue to confront, face on.  I’ve realized that I need that uncomfortableness in my life to challenge myself.  I need a little kick in the pants.</p>

I felt your presence whiz past me.  I caught a glimpse of you out of the corner of my eye.  <em>Why didn’t you stop and say hello?</em>  It’s been a while since we met.  We had a brief encounter last year, but it was not nearly long enough to really catch up.  <em>How have you been?  Do you still have that bright, enthusiastic smile?</em>  I always loved that about you.  Always sparking joy where ever you go.  People just seem to light up around you.   </p>

I think back on Scott's and my first real trip together and can feel the gravity of the change.  We went to San Francisco and I had every day mapped out to a T.  There were times when we were forced to change our plans for one reason or another, but almost every second of our days were planned out in advance.  Scott <em>finally</em> convinced me on our last day to wander around without any plans.  I was nervous, tense, confused.  <em>Well, then what are we going to do?</em>, I thought.  But I gave in because, after all, it was his vacation too.</p>
