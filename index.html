<p>I&#39;ve gone back and forth about the title of this post.  <em>Magic</em> just sounds so cheesy.  I&#39;m the one that scoffs at cheese balls and all their <em>feelings</em>.  But I&#39;ve decided to stick with it, because that&#39;s the only way that I can describe it adequately.  This so-called magic is something difficult to put into words.  You just have to experience it for yourself.  It has something to do with being so far away from other people and so close to nature.  One Finn told us that when foreigners visit Finland, and stay in her cottage out in the middle of the forest, far removed from civilization, they start getting uncomfortable.  Often times they find the solitude of the forest too much and long to be close to people, stores and other conveniences again.  But she said, “that’s where us Finns feel most at home, in the middle of the forest, with no one else around.”  It can be strange if you’re not used to that feeling, especially for a prolonged period of time, but I think I’m starting to get it.  There is something pretty cool about being engulfed by trees that tower over you, on all sides, and slowing down enough to appreciate nature in all seasons (yes, even you, bitterly cold winter).  You kind of start to crave it.<br>

<p>Even though Levi is pretty far north, it’s still a decent size town (you know, for being above the Arctic Circle). But our cottage was on the side of the mountain that is much less populated, so it felt pretty isolated.  There were no street lights on our street, so when we pulled up at 9pm the car lights were the only way we could see where we were going.  Just perfect for Northern Lights watching.  Several times a night, one of us would step out on the porch to check the sky and report back.  During our week stay, we were lucky enough to see them twice (three times, if you count the drive there).  That in itself is pretty magical.  The second night that we saw them, we stayed outside watching and taking pictures for probably two hours.  They were faint, then bright, then waves, then swirls, changing rapidly right before our eyes.  Mind-blowing.  Even though we were all pretty frozen after 2 hours, I stayed outside for 20 minutes after everyone decided to go in.  They started changing colors and I just couldn’t take my eyes away.  </p>

<p>And then there’s the animals of Lapland.  The huskies, the wolves, the arctic foxes (!) and the reindeer.  The really make the whole experience so much better.<br>

<p>One of the things that I&#39;ve come to realize, while living in Finland, is the sincere appreciation and respect Finns have for nature.  It&#39;s apparent in so many aspects of life, but it becomes especially clear in Lapland.  It&#39;s just a special place that keeps calling you back.  Hopefully someday we&#39;ll get to experience it all again.      </p>

<p>So there’s another thing you need to know about this mountain (fell) named Levi.  It’s also the name of the town.  But <em>technically</em> it’s not.  It&#39;s so confusing.  It’s actually Kittilä, which is the region or something, but everyone just calls it Levi.  I was super confused too the first time I typed “Levi, Finland” into Google Maps and nothing came up.  But everyone in Finland knows exactly what you’re talking about when you say you&#39;re going to Levi.  So now that’s all cleared up, let’s talk about all the fun we had there.  </p>

<p>Where do I begin?  The weather?  Yes.  Mother Nature really cooked up a spectacular weather week for us.  The first couple days when the sun really shows up again, after the long winter months in Finland, feel like the best days of your life.  I always forget how wonderful the sun is.  And it is, really extra wonderful.  So every morning as we sat around the table eating breakfast and looking out the window, someone always said, “<em>Wow, we really have been so lucky with this weather</em>.”  (In Finland you’re always surprised when it’s sunny for more than one day in a row).      </p>

<p>One of the best things about Lapland is all the animals that live there.  I would travel there just to see the reindeer and the huskies.  I love them that much.  But more on them later because right now I’ve got to tell you about the snowmobiles.  Snowmobiling has been on my list of things to do in Finland for a while.  The last full day we were in Levi we took some out for a two hour spin in celebration of our friend and travel partner’s birthday.  The day before, our friends had told us a horror story about two girls that had driven straight into a tree.  So I was a tad anxious.  Turns out I was a natural.  Well, maybe not a natural per se, but I did it and didn’t run into anyone or anything.  And it was so fun!  We drove around a big loop through the forest and over the frozen lake, making a couple stops to enjoy the scenery.  I think Scott’s favorite part was his helmet.  I have to admit, he kind of looked like a bad a**.  I was only slightly jealous.  </p>

<p>On our way back to the cabin we stopped at this reindeer farm.  We watched while a man, dressed in traditional Sami costume, fed the reindeer and then we cooed over the cute little reindeer for a good while.  I’ll never get tired of them.    </p>

<p>These pictures are from our first trip up the mountain.  Ok, it’s technically a fell, but that’s a mountain by Finnish standards.  So we’re going to call it a mountain.  Anyway, we drove nearly to the top to take in the view and check out the slopes one afternoon.  As soon as we opened the car doors we were blasted with some seriously cold and incredibly strong wind.  The wind was blowing so hard that the packed snow was wildly swirling through the air pummeling anything and everything around it.  There was a café not too far away from where we parked, so we all turned around, backs facing the flying snow, and walked backwards all the way there.  You could barely see anything but a cloud of white.  Our initial intention was just to hang out outside for a while looking out over the town, but the wind was so unbelievably crazy that we cut our viewing time short.  We only went into the café to rest for minute and thaw our frozen hands (from taking pictures) before walking right back through the storm.  </p>

<p>But it was worth it, don’t you think? I’ll take a good beating from the wind for that kind of view any day.  </p>

<p>The day that we went skiing on the mountain I met that ruthless wind again.  It was on our last run, just when the sun was setting.  Everything was so stinking beautiful.  But the wind was blowing harder than ever.  I couldn’t help but make a couple of pit stops for photo opts even though my hands suffered more and more each time.  By the time we made it down the mountain we were all out of breath and frozen.  But it was such a perfect ending.  Exhausted and in awe of it all.  That’s pretty much how I felt everyday of this trip.  </p>

<p>A quick double check that we packed everything - gloves, sweat pants and snacks (ya know, the essentials) - and we were out the door.  With the addition of our bags, we filled the car to the brim (Scott cleverly using plastic grocery bags for maximum squish-ability).  It was 6:30 am and we had almost 14 hours ahead of us before we would get to our cottage in Levi.  I was lucky enough to sit in the most coveted seat in the car, <em>back middle</em>, where any move you make you’re almost guarenteed to be touching someone else around you.  But I did have a straight shot of the open road, so there’s that. </p>

<p>Our two drivers were experienced road trippers so they had planned out several stops along the way to break up the drive a little.  About three hours in we stopped to check out an ice waterfall just off the road.  From the car, we walked through the forest about 1 km to the waterfall. The recent rise in temperature had thawed out the ice just enough so there was actual water flowing.</p>

<p>The next stop was Santa’s village.  How can you drive through the village and NOT stop to hang with Santa?  It was the end of his work day so we caught him with a remarkably short line.  Chatting with St. Nick for a couple of minutes gave us just enough energy to push through the last leg of the drive.       </p>

<p>The entire trip we had our eyes peeled for roaming reindeer, but none were to be seen.  Then in the last two hours, while we were trying to entertain ourselves with an exceptionally long game of Celebrity, we caught a glimpse of one dashing out of the woods.  Not long after that, as we were driving down a dark road, we spotted the Northern Lights out the window!  Of course we had to pull over to marvel at them for a while and talk about how awesome it all was.  Someone even joked that we had basically seen it all so we could just turn around and go back home.  But after 12 hours of being in the car, that wasn’t something to joke about.  </p>

<p>I’m a little afraid to say this out loud, but <em>I’m not totally over winter yet.</em>  I’m still into this whole thick sweater, steaming hot chocolate and hearty stew weather.  The winter has been good to us.  It’s given us lots of good snow and even some sunny days too!  Those days are the best.  Puts a smile on my face just thinking about them.  Except they can really fool a sun-deprived soul.  Over the weekend we had a super bright sunny day so I convinced Scott to go on a walk.  It wasn’t long after we started walking that we were reminded sun is not synonymous with warmth, not even close.</p>

<p>We’ve been trying to experience this winter like true Finns, getting out there and embracing  the white world.  That’s how you’ve got to do it.  You have to crave that sharp bite of frozen air on your face and relish in the numbness of your fingers.  I’m not <em>quite</em> there yet, but I’m working on it.  </p>

<p>So we’re just cross country skiing (way harder than it looks), ice swimming (just as cold as it looks), snowshoeing (right past bear tracks), and sledding (alongside all the small children).  It’s the best.  Yesterday we even tried curling!  That’s not so much a <em>typical</em> winter activity, but it involves ice.  And where there’s ice there is falling and knee bruises.  Winter is not for wimps.   </p>

<p>And on that note, I’m going to go crawl back under the covers with my cup of coffee and experience some more winter.         </p>
