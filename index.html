<p>I’ve been going about daily life here in Chile, posting every so often over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meredithspetit/">here</a> without giving you a proper introduction to our new town and life.  So let me back up a bit.</p>

<p>We arrived in Chile a little over a month ago and have been settled into our new town of Villarrica for about four weeks.  Villarrica is a mid-sized town in the center of southern Chile.  As I mentioned in my last post, Villarrica sits on a beautiful lake flanked by mountains and volcanos.  On the other side of the lake is Pucón, Villarrica’s more tourist-friendly neighbor.  The area is known for its access to nature and outdoor adventures (hiking, canoeing, hot springs, rafting, skiing, and so much more), which we are steadily working on checking off our list.</p>

<p><br>

</div>
<br></p>

<p>We have made our home in Villarrica in a quaint wooden cabin, just two blocks from the lake (and less than two blocks from my school).  We are learning so many new things through our adventures in cabin life, like how to keep a fire going all day (and all night), and what to do when you run out of propane in the middle of cooking dinner on your gas stove.  Reminds me of some of the fond <a href="http://coatsandkahvi.com/2013/09/03/our-new-apartment.html">memories</a> we have figuring out life in Finland.  One of the best things about our cabin is that we have a view of the Villarrica Volcano from our porch.  Every day on my way to work I get to glance over at the ever-changing peak - sometimes clear and calm, while at other times surrounded by smoke or looming clouds.  That incredible sight never gets old.  Another thing that I love about where we are living is that we walk to everything - the supermarket, the laundry, our favorite pizza place, the lake, and my school.  It’s just one of those small joys that makes the everyday a little bit more pleasantly simple.  </p>

<p>On top of this just being a wonderful little town, everyone has also been so welcoming and kind to us.  People seem to go out of their way to help the <em>gringos</em> figure out how to do things around here.  Especially our adoptive Chilean <em>padres</em> who make sure that we get our filling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado">asado</a> every weekend and keep us stocked up on fire wood so we don’t freeze our buns off.  They&#39;ve made sure that we know what a real pisco sour tastes like and how to make the simply delicious staple, Chilean salad.  They even threw Scott a birthday party complete with fresh ceviche and Chilean wine just a few days after we arrived!  They&#39;ve played a huge role in the amazing experience we’ve had so far.    </p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that we’re already a month into this because in a lot of ways I feel like we&#39;re just getting started.  There&#39;s so much to do, so much to see and time seems to be racing past us - I wish I could hit the slowmo button and stretch out the time we have left, <em>just a little bit</em>.     </p>

Jagged mountains serve as the primary backdrop to the typically glass-like water.  Though the towering volcano with smoke looming around its peak can easily steal the show with the overwhelming sense of awe it provokes.  This lake just so happens to be located two blocks from the cabin we’re currently calling home.</p>

I love going out and spending time with my friends, but I also love quiet time at home.  My entire life I’ve been labeled “the quiet one”.  When I was younger I frequently got asked, <em>“Do you speak?”</em> by people I didn’t know well.  I started to really hate that about 	myself.  I felt like it was a hurdle I had to overcome if I ever wanted to be successful.  Then the summer before my senior year in college I decided to study abroad in Spain.  I intentionally did not go through my university; instead I went with an outside program where I wouldn’t know anyone.  In some ways it was a test.  <em>Can you do this?  What will you do when you have no one to hide behind?  How will you get by without your safety net of friends?</em>  Needless to say, it was quite the shock at first.  But I adapted, and eventually it became a whole lot easier.  I passed the test.  I think I knew all along that I would, but I needed that extra push.  Without even realizing it in the moment, I was living out the mantra that I’ve been trying to live by recently - <em>If something scares you, do it</em>.  The fear that comes from the unknown is something that I want to continue to confront, face on.  I’ve realized that I need that uncomfortableness in my life to challenge myself.  I need a little kick in the pants.</p>

I felt your presence whiz past me.  I caught a glimpse of you out of the corner of my eye.  <em>Why didn’t you stop and say hello?</em>  It’s been a while since we met.  We had a brief encounter last year, but it was not nearly long enough to really catch up.  <em>How have you been?  Do you still have that bright, enthusiastic smile?</em>  I always loved that about you.  Always sparking joy where ever you go.  People just seem to light up around you.   </p>
