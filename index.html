<p>Instead of talking about how done I am with this weather and how the weather in Helsinki was equally as miserable (if not worse) and how all the pictures of warm places with people in anything less than a winter coat and boots are making me crazy... I&#39;m going to tell you about all the food we ate on our trip.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much what we did.  We ate.  So let&#39;s first talk about the Mexican-style brunch.  Anything with a slight resemblance to Mexican food and we&#39;re there.  I will admit now that it was worth the cold, wet walk over.  I&#39;m not even sure what some of the items were exactly, but I will tell you they were delicious and spicy, just how I like it.  Then there was Fafa&#39;s.  Giant falafals in fluffy pita bread.  I got the one with pesto and goat cheese.  Yes, <em>to die for</em>.  The restaurant was out of this old, white van look-alike.  Think stationary food truck.  There were only about 15 seats total, which makes you feel like you snagged a highly coveted spot.  It&#39;s located in the middle of a bunch of office buildings, so you would never find it just walking around, but we were on a mission.  Then there&#39;s my favorite, well favorites, which were all the cute cafés around town.  The one that really took the cake (I&#39;ll tell you more about that in a moment) was this small little café tucked in a corner, down the street from where we were staying.  Give me a cinnamon roll or croissant with a cappuccino for breakfast and I am a happy camper.  It&#39;s one of those places that would be very dangerous to live by because it would be calling  my name every time I passed by.  In fact it did one of the days we were there.  We were going to walk by it on the way back to our apartment so I took that as an opportunity to try a slice of cake.  I&#39;m not a huge cake person, well really not a huge frosting person, but these cakes were of the homemade variety.  They were different every day.  <em>Who eats cake in the middle of the day on no special occasion</em>, you ask?  I asked myself the same question, after my teeth were already covered in chocolatey goodness, and I decided the answer was that people who live by this place do.  So as I was temporarily living near for a couple of days, I should do as the locals do.  </p>

<p>Clearly we needed some comforting from the weather.  And we found it in the food.  It really is amazing how much the weather dictates what you eat.  So to survive this next month of on and off rain/snow/sleet, we&#39;re going to be making some really comforting food around here.  Starting with our favorite Moroccan-style stew.  Mmmmm...I can already taste those sweet spices infused with the melt-in-your-mouth sweet potatoes.              </p>

<p>Some have Spring break, we have Ski break.  Both occur in March and are all about taking a little time from school to enjoy the outdoors.  Other than that, they have nothing in common.  Spring break is swimming pools, swim suits and sun.  Ski break is snow ball fights, snow shoeing and of course, skiing.  (Ok, I just noticed that they all start with S&#39;s too...so there&#39;s that).  I&#39;m all about these sorts of icy outings and I feel like I&#39;ve been a pretty darn good sport about the winter, but I&#39;m going to go ahead and call it.  I can not fool my Texas brain into thinking we&#39;re still in December.  It knows better.  It knows that this is the time to start breaking out the shorts and eating outside.  This snow just isn&#39;t going to do it for me anymore.  I&#39;m on board for it coming back in about 8 months.  But now, it&#39;s time to stop this madness.  It&#39;s been real.  Needless to say, we are not headed for the slopes next week.  We&#39;re boarding the train headed south.  Literally.  We&#39;re going to Helsinki.  Unfortunately it&#39;s not exactly beachy there either, but we&#39;ll take what we can get right now.  If you could direct any heat waves that you find in this general direction, we would greatly appreciate it.          </p>

<p>As the days go by, I learn more and more about the Finnish culture.  I know that we&#39;ve lived here for almost 6 months now, but it continues to fascinate me.  For one, Finns come alive in the winter.  It&#39;s like someone flipped a switch and everyone suddenly sprang to life.  When the days get down to 20 or below, you can see the smiles on their faces and hear the excitement in their voices.  <em>Finally</em>, they say, <em>a proper winter</em>!  They use words like <em>fresh</em> to describe freezing temperatures.  I guess when winter takes up a majority of the year, you learn to embrace it.  No, they don&#39;t embrace it, they <em>thrive</em> off it.  All year they are waiting until the conditions are right for skiing, ice hockey, skating, ice fishing and all their other favorite winter activities.  They will tell you that the best sauna is the one when you can take a break from the heat to roll around in the snow (with no clothes on).  Now, I don&#39;t want to make any over-generalizations about the entire population.  I have met a Finn that wasn&#39;t a fan of winter, but I&#39;d say those are few and far between.  Most of the time, you will find them enjoying the outdoors during these snow-covered days.  </p>

<p>Although I don&#39;t know if I quite thrive  off these northern temperatures yet, I have learned to embrace them.  I get to try so many things that I&#39;ve never done before, like snowshoeing.  The other day a group of us went on a snowshoeing trek on and around a peninsula in Joensuu.  It took a little while to get used to waddling like a duck in the shoes, but soon it came naturally.  When we got to the lake our guides told us that we were going to cross by walking <em>on</em> the lake.  I was a little hesitant at first because I didn&#39;t totally trust that the water was frozen and would be able to hold my weight (plus 10 other people), but Finnish people usually know what they&#39;re talking about when it comes to nature, so I went for it.  In the distance there were people snowmobiling, ice fishing and generally just enjoying an afternoon on the lake.  Being completely new to all this cold weather stuff, it was still kind of crazy to think about an entire lake being frozen.  Oh, and the sun peeked through the clouds for a couple of minutes.  That&#39;s enough to lift my spirit for days.  It was a great way to spend an afternoon and when I got home I was exhausted.  While we were out there I didn&#39;t feel like it was strenuous, but I guess 3 hours of snowshoeing will take it out of you.  </p>

<p>(I know that everything I write about revolves around it being cold, but that pretty much sums up our lives right now.  <em>Cold and winter.</em>) </p>

<p>We are in the thick of winter over here.  Maybe that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t posted in a while.  Not because we&#39;ve been in hibernation (as I predicted in my last post), it has been quite the opposite actually, I think it&#39;s because we&#39;re really getting settled in now.  We have routines, schedules, and everything feels so normal now.  Like this is our home.  It no longer feels strange to be <em>carless</em>.  In fact, it was a weird feeling riding in a friend&#39;s car the other weekend.  When the temperature gets up to the 20&#39;s, we celebrate – I have actually said out loud, <em>it feels great outside today!</em>  Never in my life would I have guessed those words would come out of my mouth, when there is snow on the ground and I am covered in three layers of clothing.  We cook every meal at home.  At first we were forced into this due to the lack of restaurants nearby (<em>or really just period</em>), but now I&#39;m really getting into it.  I look forward to making the next meal and am becoming quite territorial in the kitchen (I&#39;m working on it).  We have great friends who we get to hang out with every week.  That really makes living anywhere enjoyable.  We share our different customs and holidays with each other, like a little international family.  Last weekend we celebrated Chinese New Year with some delicious, traditional dishes and the other day I learned how to make tortilla española, <em>Mmmm</em>.  This weekend we celebrated Super Bowl Sunday (<em>that&#39;s a holiday, right?</em>).  Since we figured it wasn&#39;t worth staying up to watch the game in the middle of the night, we postponed our viewing party.  We replayed the game,  even though we already knew the outcome (the commercials and halftime show are where it&#39;s at).  And as expected, there was a continuous stream of questions about this barbaric sport Americans&#39; lives revolve around for half of the year.   </p>

<p>When I go back and look at pictures or posts from, say, October or November, I laugh at the fact that I thought it was cold then.  <em>What a joke!</em>  But I do think I <em>finally</em> realize what everyone meant when they said it was going to get much, much colder.  They meant that your breath would freeze your hair to your scarf, your fingers would burn, your nose would run to the extent that you could no longer feel it.  They meant that all you would crave is a hearty soup and some hot tea.  They meant that when you are forced to wear three layers (pants and jackets) to walk five minutes to the grocery store and when sleeping at school sounds like a better alternative than riding your bike home...that&#39;s when you know it&#39;s cold.  So in case you&#39;re wondering, we will be in full hibernation mode for the next month and a half.</p>

<p>I know that this is going to contradict my previous statement about being in hibernation, but I guess I&#39;m not really made for <em>full</em> hibernating, even in the coldest of weather.  Some friends invited us to go to the Polar Bear Club for some ice swimming over the weekend.  It was not an easy decision to make.  To start, because it would take us 30 minutes to get there, and that in itself sounds like torture in this weather.  Then we would voluntarily be subjecting ourselves to swimming in a hole cut out in the frozen river.  None of this really sounded inticing, except for the fact that it would get us out of our apartment to see other people.  <em>Soooo, we went.</em></p>

<p>It goes like this – sauna, swimming, sauna, repeat.  The idea is to get really hot in the sauna and then when you can&#39;t take it any longer, you go cool off in the ice cold water.  The river was about 30 feet from the sauna.  I knew if it didn&#39;t go straight in and I gave myself time to think, it wasn&#39;t going to happen.  So when I got to the point when I couldn&#39;t take the heat of the sauna any longer, I marched straight down to the river and immediately got in.  When my foot first hit the water, while walking down the ladder, I thought, <em>this is not so bad</em>.  Then I lowered my entire body in and froze.  When the water pierced through to my bones, I wanted to scream.  But it won&#39;t let you.  You are left with no voice.  Your adrenaline is the only thing that allows you to swim to the other ladder to expel yourself from the water as fast as humanly possible.  As soon as you get out, your voice comes back and you can finally say, <em>AHHHHH, that was sooo cold</em>!!  Then for the next couple minutes you feel great.  Like you could stand outside, in the 7 degree weather, in your bathing suit, all day.  After that feeling wears off you realize you most definitely could <em>not</em> stand out there any longer, much less all day, and you proceed to walk (probably closer to a run) back to the sauna.  </p>

<p>As much as I despise being cold, I can&#39;t say that we&#39;ll never do it again.  After all, it is just one of those things you do here during the wintertime.  And since we still have a good amount of winter ahead of us, we might as well embrace it.   </p>
