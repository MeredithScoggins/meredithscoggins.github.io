<p>Tucked away in the foothills of the Andes Mountains in San Fernando, Chile is the coziest lodge.  The instant you pull into the property you can feel your shoulders drop and you begin breathing a little deeper.  Walking up to the lodge you’re greeted by two friendly Saint Bernards who then escort you to the door.  You’re shown to one of four rooms to drop of your luggage before joining the others for a glass of wine by the fire.  </p>

<p>As soon as we settled in I knew that we had haphazardly stumbled upon something special.  To be honest, I didn’t really know what to expect when we booked our stay.  We chose the lodge for its affordable rooms and its proximity to wineries and hiking trails.  The experience we had was far beyond anything I imagined.  Every single detail of your experience at <a href="http://www.tumunanlodge.com/">Tumuñan Lodge</a> has been carefully thought out by Will and Carolina, the couple who built and expertly run this little oasis.  </p>

<p>During our stay, Will spent time talking to us about all the different wines in the region and his personal process in starting his own vineyard on the property.  One day he organized a trip for us to explore the impressive <a href="http://www.museocolchagua.cl/">museum</a> in Santa Cruz, a delicious seafood lunch at <a href="http://www.vino-bello.com/en/27861/ristorante">Ristorante Vino Bello</a>, and a tour of <a href="http://www.neyenwine.com/Home">Neyen Vineyards</a> where we learned more about the wine making process.  Carolina prepared absolutely incredible food at every meal.  I don’t know if I can truly pick a favorite because it was all so delicious, but the beef stew was particularly amazing (and I’m not usually that much of a beef fan).  Because there are only four rooms in the lodge everything can be and is tailored to your needs and desires.  The day that we went on a <a href="http://coatsandkahvi.com/2016/08/04/Hiking-the-Andes-Mountains.html">hike</a> they packed a picnic lunch for us to enjoy while we were out and, we ended up rounding off the day with a wine tasting at the lodge. </p>

<p>What I really loved about Tumuñan Lodge was that you could make your stay whatever you wanted it to be - a relaxing getaway spent with wine and good books, or a place to explore the bountiful nature in the valley, or a retreat after a day of visiting wineries in the area.  I was so blown away by our experience at Tumuñan Lodge - the service and the attention to detail were top-notch.  So if you’re looking to explore Chile’s wine regions or just looking for a quiet weekend getaway, you don’t want to miss out on this place.  I’d go back in a heartbeat.  </p>

Although we were thoroughly enjoying the days spent drinking wine by the fire, we were staying right in the foothills of the Andes and were anxious to get out and see the outdoors.  So as soon as we saw a rain-free day we planned to make the most of it and spend the day hiking.<br><br>With a very rough map in hand we started out packed with food, water, and extra layers.  The first stop on our map was a waterfall hidden amongst a bamboo forest.  We walked towards the crescendo of rushing water as we parted the sticks of bamboo moving steadily through the forest.  Once we spent significant time admiring the unique beauty of the lagoon, we continued on our way passing through sections of thick forest to wide open spaces where the vastness of the mountains was undeniable.  Almost every half hour one of us gawked at the incredible view before us.</p>

One of our stops along the way was Valparaíso, a coastal town not too far from Santiago.  When you arrive in Valparaíso it is as if you have traveled to another country entirely.  It's unlike anywhere else I have been in Chile, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  The town is filled with quirkiness and is most known for it's abundance of street art that covers almost every building.  It's sensory overload, in the best way.  We spent our short time there just wandering around, up and down all the hills, taking it all in (<em>that and eating a lot</em>).</p>

Memories of the places that they've taken me, both the incredible and the tough times that they've seen, and all the stories that they could tell came rushing towards me faster than I could process. Traveling has forced me to make purposeful decisions about my clothes, taking into account their flexibilty amongst different seasons, practicality, comfort, and style.  When I got home and put my boots away in the closet I took a quick scan of my clothes to see if anything else stood out to me as particularly meaningful.  When I did, I noticed that there were several key pieces in my wardrobe that I continue to reach for again and again no matter where we are.</p>
