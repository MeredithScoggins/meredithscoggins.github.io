<p>So there’s another thing you need to know about this mountain (fell) named Levi.  It’s also the name of the town.  But <em>technically</em> it’s not.  It&#39;s so confusing.  It’s actually Kittilä, which is the region or something, but everyone just calls it Levi.  I was super confused too the first time I typed “Levi, Finland” into Google Maps and nothing came up.  But everyone in Finland knows exactly what you’re talking about when you say you&#39;re going to Levi.  So now that’s all cleared up, let’s talk about all the fun we had there.  </p>

<p>Where do I begin?  The weather?  Yes.  Mother Nature really cooked up a spectacular weather week for us.  The first couple days when the sun really shows up again, after the long winter months in Finland, feel like the best days of your life.  I always forget how wonderful the sun is.  And it is, really extra wonderful.  So every morning as we sat around the table eating breakfast and looking out the window, someone always said, “<em>Wow, we really have been so lucky with this weather</em>.”  (In Finland you’re always surprised when it’s sunny for more than one day in a row).      </p>

<p>One of the best things about Lapland is all the animals that live there.  I would travel there just to see the reindeer and the huskies.  I love them that much.  But more on them later because right now I’ve got to tell you about the snowmobiles.  Snowmobiling has been on my list of things to do in Finland for a while.  The last full day we were in Levi we took some out for a two hour spin in celebration of our friend and travel partner’s birthday.  The day before, our friends had told us a horror story about two girls that had driven straight into a tree.  So I was a tad anxious.  Turns out I was a natural.  Well, maybe not a natural per se, but I did it and didn’t run into anyone or anything.  And it was so fun!  We drove around a big loop through the forest and over the frozen lake, making a couple stops to enjoy the scenery.  I think Scott’s favorite part was his helmet.  I have to admit, he kind of looked like a bad a**.  I was only slightly jealous.  </p>

<p>On our way back to the cabin we stopped at this reindeer farm.  We watched while a man, dressed in traditional Sami costume, fed the reindeer and then we cooed over the cute little reindeer for a good while.  I’ll never get tired of them.    </p>

<p>These pictures are from our first trip up the mountain.  Ok, it’s technically a fell, but that’s a mountain by Finnish standards.  So we’re going to call it a mountain.  Anyway, we drove nearly to the top to take in the view and check out the slopes one afternoon.  As soon as we opened the car doors we were blasted with some seriously cold and incredibly strong wind.  The wind was blowing so hard that the packed snow was wildly swirling through the air pummeling anything and everything around it.  There was a café not too far away from where we parked, so we all turned around, backs facing the flying snow, and walked backwards all the way there.  You could barely see anything but a cloud of white.  Our initial intention was just to hang out outside for a while looking out over the town, but the wind was so unbelievably crazy that we cut our viewing time short.  We only went into the café to rest for minute and thaw our frozen hands (from taking pictures) before walking right back through the storm.  </p>

<p>But it was worth it, don’t you think? I’ll take a good beating from the wind for that kind of view any day.  </p>

<p>The day that we went skiing on the mountain I met that ruthless wind again.  It was on our last run, just when the sun was setting.  Everything was so stinking beautiful.  But the wind was blowing harder than ever.  I couldn’t help but make a couple of pit stops for photo opts even though my hands suffered more and more each time.  By the time we made it down the mountain we were all out of breath and frozen.  But it was such a perfect ending.  Exhausted and in awe of it all.  That’s pretty much how I felt everyday of this trip.  </p>

<p>A quick double check that we packed everything - gloves, sweat pants and snacks (ya know, the essentials) - and we were out the door.  With the addition of our bags, we filled the car to the brim (Scott cleverly using plastic grocery bags for maximum squish-ability).  It was 6:30 am and we had almost 14 hours ahead of us before we would get to our cottage in Levi.  I was lucky enough to sit in the most coveted seat in the car, <em>back middle</em>, where any move you make you’re almost guarenteed to be touching someone else around you.  But I did have a straight shot of the open road, so there’s that. </p>

<p>Our two drivers were experienced road trippers so they had planned out several stops along the way to break up the drive a little.  About three hours in we stopped to check out an ice waterfall just off the road.  From the car, we walked through the forest about 1 km to the waterfall. The recent rise in temperature had thawed out the ice just enough so there was actual water flowing.</p>

<p>The next stop was Santa’s village.  How can you drive through the village and NOT stop to hang with Santa?  It was the end of his work day so we caught him with a remarkably short line.  Chatting with St. Nick for a couple of minutes gave us just enough energy to push through the last leg of the drive.       </p>

<p>The entire trip we had our eyes peeled for roaming reindeer, but none were to be seen.  Then in the last two hours, while we were trying to entertain ourselves with an exceptionally long game of Celebrity, we caught a glimpse of one dashing out of the woods.  Not long after that, as we were driving down a dark road, we spotted the Northern Lights out the window!  Of course we had to pull over to marvel at them for a while and talk about how awesome it all was.  Someone even joked that we had basically seen it all so we could just turn around and go back home.  But after 12 hours of being in the car, that wasn’t something to joke about.  </p>

<p>I’m a little afraid to say this out loud, but <em>I’m not totally over winter yet.</em>  I’m still into this whole thick sweater, steaming hot chocolate and hearty stew weather.  The winter has been good to us.  It’s given us lots of good snow and even some sunny days too!  Those days are the best.  Puts a smile on my face just thinking about them.  Except they can really fool a sun-deprived soul.  Over the weekend we had a super bright sunny day so I convinced Scott to go on a walk.  It wasn’t long after we started walking that we were reminded sun is not synonymous with warmth, not even close.</p>

<p>We’ve been trying to experience this winter like true Finns, getting out there and embracing  the white world.  That’s how you’ve got to do it.  You have to crave that sharp bite of frozen air on your face and relish in the numbness of your fingers.  I’m not <em>quite</em> there yet, but I’m working on it.  </p>

<p>So we’re just cross country skiing (way harder than it looks), ice swimming (just as cold as it looks), snowshoeing (right past bear tracks), and sledding (alongside all the small children).  It’s the best.  Yesterday we even tried curling!  That’s not so much a <em>typical</em> winter activity, but it involves ice.  And where there’s ice there is falling and knee bruises.  Winter is not for wimps.   </p>

<p>And on that note, I’m going to go crawl back under the covers with my cup of coffee and experience some more winter.         </p>

<p>We had been tossing around the idea of a beach vacation for a little while, so when we stumbled upon Tulum we were sold.  It was going to be hard to live up to our expectations because we had hyped it up so much, but it did not disappoint.  Not in the least.  In fact, I think it was even better than we imagined.  Tulum used to be a fairly tourist-free corner of Mexico, but in recent years its secret has been plastered all over the internet.  Normally, that would mean it&#39;s now overrun with giant resorts, chain restaurants and souvenir shops.  Although I don’t really know what it was like before, I’d say that it has blown up in the best way possible.  </p>

<p>When we turned onto the street parallel to the beach (the one with all the hotels), we immediately fell in love with this little jungle paradise.  You won’t find any big resorts on the beach, like you’ll see in Cancun and Playa del Carmen, instead it’s lined with small boutique-like hotels.  Our hotel had eight rooms, and five of them were huts disconnected from the main building.  It was a dream.  We spent our days laying on the beach, stuffing ourselves with the most delicious Mexican food (can you ever have too much?) and exploring the town.  Take me back.  </p>

<p>The most memorable part of the trip was the night that we spent eating dinner at a fancy little restaurant on the beach.  They don’t have lights on the beach at night, so Scott and I were eating our meal looking out at the dark beach.  Not long after we started eating we saw several people walking down the beach with red laser-type lights.  We didn’t think much of it at first, but when we started to see more people using their lights to look in the bushes near the restaurant, we began to get curious.  We finally asked our waiter what they were all doing and he told us that they were looking for <em>
tortuguitas</em> (baby turtles).  I freaked.  I had been talking about seeing a baby sea turtle months before our trip, but I didn’t think it was going to happen.  Apparently, when the turtles hatch they can’t see very well so they just move towards the light.  In a completely natural environment the moon reflecting off the water is the brightest light, so they instinctively go in that direction.  On beaches where there are hotels and other unnatural light sources, the turtles get confused by all the bright lights.  So these people were attempting to find the turtles and lead them to the ocean with their red light.  I didn’t want to disrupt the search, but I was itching to see one.  So as soon as I heard a couple yelling that they had found one, I abandoned my food at the table and sprinted down the beach, on my tippy toes, as to not step on one.  I am not kidding when I say that it was one of the cutest and most amazing things I’ve seen.  This tiny little turtle, moving ever so slowly, to the vast ocean for its first time.  Then I went back to a mouthwatering dinner, and rehashed how amazing it was.  <em>For the rest of dinner.</em>  Best night.                         </p>
