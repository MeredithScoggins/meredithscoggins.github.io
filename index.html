<p>Our time in Finland is sadly coming to an end, quicker than I care to admit.  I find myself getting sentimental while I’m doing the most mundane things.  Thinking of everything that I’m going to miss about this place has really made me pay attention to the little things.  So today I’m going to give you a glimpse of one of the things that we have grown to love throughout our time here - our neighborhood.  </p>

<p>We live in a neighborhood called Rantakyla, about 5 km from the center of Joensuu.  It only takes us about twenty minutes to bike to the city center, but somehow it feels like a world away.  If you drive through Rantakyla, you probably wouldn’t give it a second thought (or really even a first).  There’s not much here.  We’ve got the essentials, but nothing crazy like a <em>restaurant</em> or anything.  (Full disclosure: There is a take-away pizza place that we discovered recently and have taken advantage of twice.  It comes in handy when you, <em>say</em>, melt a plastic bowl in the oven.)  </p>

<p>After living here for almost two years, this little neighborhood of ours has become a special part of our lives.  All its little intricacies have made it endearing in a way.  There’s our friendly neighborhood S Market cashiers (who we visit on a daily basis), the sweet old lady at the pharmacy, and the late night karaoke enthusiasts.  Then there&#39;s our secret beach (which turned out to be not so secret after all), where you can picnic during the summer and walk on the frozen lake in the winter.  And the horse barn just down the road.  We have tennis courts that turn into ice skating and hockey rinks in the winter, and you&#39;ll always find someone out there playing as long as the lights are on.  When you need to get out of the house, you can always find a new path to take through the woods.  There&#39;s a whole little world here, just waiting to be discovered. </p>

<p>This little neighborhood is where Scott and I lived together for the first time.  It&#39;s where we spent our first Christmas away from our families.  It&#39;s where we saw a spectacular dance of the Northern Lights.  And it&#39;s the home we have come back to over the last two years.  Rantakyla may not be the most exciting place in Finland, but it will forever have a special place in our hearts.       </p>

It’s not just a couple flakes here and there, it’s a full on downpour that lasts for days.  You got me again, Spring.  I fall for your antics every time.  <em>April fools? No?</em>  You’re right, I should know you better than that. </p> <div class="image"> <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.07+Spring+in+Finland/Spring+in+Finland-20.jpg" width="970" /> <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.07+Spring+in+Finland/Spring-3.jpg" width="970" /> <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.04.07+Spring+in+Finland/Spring+in+Finland-21.jpg" width="970" /></div>

        <img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.23+The+Magic+of+Lapland/northern+lights-10.jpg" /> <p>  I've gone back and forth about the title of this post.  <em>Magic</em> just sounds so cheesy.  I'm the one that scoffs at cheese balls and all their <em>feelings</em>.  But I've decided to stick with it, because that's the only way that I can describe it adequately. This so-called magic is something difficult to put into words.  You just have to experience it for yourself.  It has something to do with being so far away from other people and so close to nature.  One Finn told us that when foreigners visit Finland, and stay in her cottage out in the middle of the forest, far removed from civilization, they start getting uncomfortable.  Often times they find the solitude of the forest too much and long to be close to people, stores and other conveniences again.  But she said, “that’s where us Finns feel most at home, in the middle of the forest, with no one else around.”  It can be strange if you’re not used to that feeling, especially for a prolonged period of time, but I think I’m starting to get it.  There is something pretty cool about being engulfed by trees that tower over you, on all sides, and slowing down enough to appreciate nature in all seasons (yes, even you, bitterly cold winter).  You kind of start to crave it. </p><div class="image"><img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.23+The+Magic+of+Lapland/arctic+foxes.jpg" width="970" /><img style="margin-bottom:0" alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.23+The+Magic+of+Lapland/reindeer-8.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.23+The+Magic+of+Lapland/arctic+fox-3.jpg" width="970"/></div>

It’s also the name of the town.  But <em>technically</em> it’s not.  It's so confusing.  It’s actually Kittilä, which is the region or something, but everyone just calls it Levi.  I was super confused too the first time I typed “Levi, Finland” into Google Maps and nothing came up.  But everyone in Finland knows exactly what you’re talking about when you say you're going to Levi.  So now that’s all cleared up, let’s talk about all the fun we had there. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi/reindeer_skull.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi/Levi-4.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi/Levi-5.jpg" width="970"/></div>

Ok, it’s technically a fell, but that’s a mountain by Finnish standards.  So we’re going to call it a mountain.  Anyway, we drove nearly to the top to take in the view and check out the slopes one afternoon.  As soon as we opened the car doors we were blasted with some seriously cold and incredibly strong wind.  The wind was blowing so hard that the packed snow was wildly swirling through the air pummeling anything and everything around it.  There was a café not too far away from where we parked, so we all turned around, backs facing the flying snow, and walked backwards all the way there.  You could barely see anything but a cloud of white.  Our initial intention was just to hang out outside for a while looking out over the town, but the wind was so unbelievably crazy that we cut our viewing time short.  We only went into the café to rest for minute and thaw our frozen hands (from taking pictures) before walking right back through the storm. </p><div class="image"><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-1.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-3.jpg" width="970" /><img alt="Photo by Meredith Scoggins" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coatsandkahvi/2015.03.20+Levi+mountain/levi+mountain-4.jpg" width="970"/></div>
