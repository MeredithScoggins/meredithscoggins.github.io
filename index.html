<p>
Buenos Aires is a huge city with so many things to do and see! It&#39;s the wonderful mix of many different cultures that makes the city so interesting and unique.  We were only there long enough to barely scratch the surface, so I hope to go back one day and dig in a little deeper.  </p>

<p>
<strong>1. PURUSE THE TRENDY SHOPS OF PALERMO</strong>
<br>
The Palermo neighborhood is a collection of trendy restaurants and boutique shops. It's a great place to grab a <em>good</em> cup of coffee or stop for a bite to eat.  For all the coffee nerds (like us), check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fullcitycoffeehouse/">Full City Coffee</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FelixFelicisCoffee">Félix Felices & Co</a>. Then for lunch I recommend stopping for a burger at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BurgerJointPalermo">The Burger Joint</a>.  I normally don't order a burger when I'm out (espeically when I'm traveling), but these were well worth it.  
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>2. TAKE A WALK AROUND LA BOCA</strong>
<br>
You can't visit Buenos Aires without taking some time to walk around the Boca neighborhood, home to the famous Boca Juniors football team.  The area is filled with colorful buildings, street vendors, and kids playing football.  It can be pretty touristy in some parts, but I still think it's worth a walk through to get a glimpse of the unique culture.   
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>3. TRY AN ASSORTMENT OF EMPANADAS AND WASH THEM DOWN WITH SOME MATE</strong>
<br>
Empanadas are everywhere in BA.  It's hard not to buy one from every little bakery you pass.  They come in all different shapes, sizes, and flavors, so make sure to try a variety of them.  Most of them are savory, but if you love them that much you could have them as your main dish and dessert!  To accompany your afternoon snack, try some mate to share with friends.  Mate is a type of tea typically consummed at home, but you can find some restaurants that serve it as well. It's meant to be passed around and shared with friends.    
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>4. CHEER ON ONE OF THE CITY’S TOP FOOTBALL TEAMS</strong>
<br>
One of the best experiences that we had in Buenos Aires was attending a football match.  I feel like it encapsulates so much of Argentinian culture.  To see the dedication and intensity of the fans cheering on their favorite team, is an unforgettable sight.  We went to see Racing Club vs. Boca Juniors with <a href="http://landingpadba.com/">Landing Pad</a> tour company.  I highly recommended checking them out if you're interested in going to a football match.  The provide an amazing service complete with pre-game snacks and drinks, along with transport to and from the stadium.  You will not regret it. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>5. EXPERIENCE THE CITY AFTER DARK</strong>
<br>
Buenos Aires really comes alive when the sun goes down.  Tons of people fill the streets, restaurants, bars, and clubs.  If you want to get a feel of daily life in BA, go to a late dinner then walk around and find a bar that the locals frequent.  Even better, start up a converstaion with someone at the bar and learn about the <em>porteño</em> way of life.  Have them point you in the direction of a local tango club where you can witness (or participate in) a whole sub-culture of the city.

</div>

<p><strong>*BONUS CHALLENGE*</strong>: SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT A DOG WALKER WITH MORE THAN 17 DOGS! 
<br>
Walking dogs could be an olympic sport in BA.  I have never seen so many people around the city walking more than 5 dogs at once.  I'm pretty sure that the most we saw was about 17 dogs at once, so I challenge you to top that!

I felt your presence whiz past me.  I caught a glimpse of you out of the corner of my eye.  <em>Why didn’t you stop and say hello?</em>  It’s been a while since we met.  We had a brief encounter last year, but it was not nearly long enough to really catch up.  <em>How have you been?  Do you still have that bright, enthusiastic smile?</em>  I always loved that about you.  Always sparking joy where ever you go.  People just seem to light up around you.   </p>

I think back on Scott's and my first real trip together and can feel the gravity of the change.  We went to San Francisco and I had every day mapped out to a T.  There were times when we were forced to change our plans for one reason or another, but almost every second of our days were planned out in advance.  Scott <em>finally</em> convinced me on our last day to wander around without any plans.  I was nervous, tense, confused.  <em>Well, then what are we going to do?</em>, I thought.  But I gave in because, after all, it was his vacation too.</p>

This is a cycle that I have come to know intimately.  It goes something like this - get motivated one way or another, make a plan, start studying, slowly lose momentum, wake up one day and realize that I haven't done anything in over a month.  Cue extreme guilt and questioning if I will ever be able to stick with it long enough to speak fluently.  Lately, though, when this happens I am learning to forgive myself for losing track of my goals by not harping on it - I just have to get back to work.  It’s not easy, it never is, but I have to keep moving forward. </p>

We’re gearing up to make a cross-continental move.  This time in the opposite direction - down to the southern hemisphere.  We will be settling in Chile where I will be teaching English in a Chilean public school.  There are still many unknowns, which can occasionally lead to uneasiness, but mostly we're just really excited.  The plan is to be in Chile for about 8 months and get to know the country as best as we can while we're there.  Before we get to Chile we'll be making a week stopover in Buenos Aires to get a little taste of Argentina (think prime beef, wine and empanadas).  </p>
