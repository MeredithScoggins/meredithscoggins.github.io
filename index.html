<p>For all of those who have prayed, hoped and wished for warm weather to make its way to Finland, thank you, it has.  Now if we could work on a little AC up in here, that’d be really cool (no pun intended). I am so thankful for and loving all this warm weather and sun shine that we’ve been getting, really I am.  Everyone is happy, people are out and about and picnics are happening all over the city.  It’s the best.  But when it’s 80+ outside and you have to be inside, with no AC, well let’s just say if it weren’t for the mosquitos I’d be sleeping in the forest.  When the wind blows our door closed, I sprint to prop it back open to prevent an immediate pool of sweat and suffocation.  I have my fly swatter (thanks mom) ready at all times in case one of those annoying creatures tries to sneak their way through the open windows and doors.  But I know that sooner than I care to admit the chilling winds will be back again and open windows won’t even be an option, so I’m going to turn that fan on high and keep reminding myself that it’s better than frozen eyelashes. </p>

<p>So a little over a month ago we took a trip to Paris for a week with Scott’s parents.  I’m going to blame the fact that I’m just now writing about it on the mere three weeks that I’ve spent in Joensuu since the beginning of June AND my little motivation to do anything that involves my legs sticking to a chair while staring at a computer.  Yep, that’s my excuse.  My idea of Paris was pretty much the same one that is portrayed on TV.  Beautiful, wonderful, romantic…just about everything perfect squished into one city.  There’s so much hype around the city that I thought there was no way it could live up to my (and many people’s) expectations.  But as cliché as it sounds, I did kind of fall just a little bit in love with the city.  The museums, churches and Eiffel Tower are all amazing, but what I really loved was the everyday kind of stuff.  Like the millions of cafés lining every street, filled with people enjoying the weather and good company.  And the parks, or just dots of green, for people to bring their picnics of baguettes, cheese and a bottle of wine (yes, that actually happens in real life).  Oh, and all the buildings.  I just couldn’t get enough of the white-grayish old buildings that give the city it’s relaxed, romantic feel.  It also didn’t hurt that we had near perfect weather the entire time we were there, which really makes everything better.  I don’t know what it is about the city. You can do nothing except sit at a café and people-watch, and at the end of the day you still feel like you’ve had a pretty solid day.  But that’s what’s so great about it. </p>

<p>We woke up at 5:00 am, rolled out of bed, stumbled downstairs to pick up our carefully packed breakfast and began our journey to Gdańsk.  The first 2 hours on the bus were pretty silent.  Occasionally you could hear a short mumbled conversation, but for the most far it was silent, with heads bobbing up and down, trying desperately to get more sleep.  As we arrived in Gdańsk, heads began to perk up and eyes were peeled open to take in the new city.  Our first stop was a boat ride and tour of some of the historical WWII sites.  Seeing the city by boat was a fun new perspective as we watched people enjoying the warm sun and the colorful waterfront buildings pass by.  </p>

<p>After a big helping of pierogi (Polish dumplings) for lunch, we spent some time walking around the city, marveling at the beautiful churches and mesmerizing buildings.  Gdańsk is known as the capital of amber, with tons of street vendors displaying an array of jewelry made with the Baltic gold, so of course we couldn’t leave without some time spent shopping.  Our last stop, before heading back, was a quick trip to the beach on the Baltic Sea.  The beach was packed with people lounging in padded beach chairs, under umbrellas and a few brave souls who ventured out to the frigid water.  We left Gdańsk beat from the long, action-packed day, while simultaneously craving more time in the lively port town.   </p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised with all that the city had to offer from the rich history, the cheerful old town and the lovely beaches.  I couldn’t help but think about what a perfect weekend getaway destination it would be.       </p>

<p>First of all, YAY we’re back in Joensuu!  The past month has been full of fun times and great memories, but I sure was ready to be back in my own bed.  The first two weeks of the trip I was in Toruń, Poland working with students from three other countries on an intensive summer course.  The topic was building intercultural awareness in teaching English as a foreign language.  We arrived late Sunday night after a 4.5 hour train to Helsinki, 2 hour flight to Warsaw and then a 4 hour bus ride to Toruń.  Then early Monday morning we were up for the beginning of ten long days in class (don&#39;t worry, we managed to squeeze in some time for fun).  There were nine other students from UEF that went on the trip, so I got to make some pretty great friends as well.  </p>

<p>Now let’s talk about Poland.  Go there.  Seriously, it’s such an interesting, beautiful country filled with so much history.  In Toruń there was a wonderful Old Town filled with ornate, colorful buildings that I could just stare at all day (maybe that’s why I have so many pictures of them).  And because we were studying with Polish students, we also got to learn a lot about Polish culture. For instance, what I would call ‘lunch’ they refer to as ‘dinner’ and it’s eaten at around 1 pm.  The meal generally consists of three courses and starts with a soup, then you have the entrée, which is usually some sort of meat and potatoes, and then a dessert.  Later you have ‘supper’ which is around 6 pm and is generally some form of sandwich.  Being in Poland, we followed the same daily meal schedule.  I always find it interesting to learn about other food cultures.  I think you can tell a lot about a culture from how and what they eat.  We also learned a little about Nicolaus Copernicus, who is the pride and joy of Toruń.  There&#39;s a statue of him in the center of the old town and the univeristy, where we were studying, is named after him.  As our welcoming gift, we all got Nicolaus Copernicus zip drives!   </p>

<p>Although we were in class a lot, there were still plenty late nights hanging out with new friends from Spain, France, Poland (and of course, Finland).  That was the best part of the trip.  Just talking, laughing and being with those people.  After two weeks of cramming in a ridiculous amount of work and play, I was completely worn out, but it was so so worth it.           </p>

<p>Mother Nature really pulled through this weekend.  Clear skies and rising temperatures made for a pretty perfect market day.  The first traditional fish market in Joensuu was held on Saturday where vendors sold fresh fish, homemade jams, wooden handicrafts and lots of other goodies.  We sat outside eating our crucified salmon and all our winter woes were forgotten.  There’s just something about outdoor markets that makes me smile.  I don’t know if it’s the warm weather that generally accompanies them, the smell of freshly cooked food or the community feel to the whole event, but it sure makes for a solid afternoon.  </p>

<p>Now, I don’t want to disappoint anyone by skipping over the weather report, so here it goes, today was <strong>hot</strong>.  I know you’re thinking, <em>you mean like you only had to wear one pair of wool socks kind of weather?</em>  Nope.  Like shorts and sandals and sunbathing kind of weather.  Seriously.  The city was crawling with people soaking it all up.  I’d say about 50% of the people we passed were carrying ice cream cones (including me).  Every pier we passed on the way home was occupied by picnic-ers.  We bought a fan.  These are the signs of summer.  I’m still a bit hesitant to leave the house without gloves and a jacket, I just feel naked without them, but I’m sure pretty soon I won’t be giving them a second thought. </p>

<p>Oh and the last, <em>but definitely not the least</em>, glorious thing to report, we ate barbecue today.  I’m not talking about Finnish BBQ, which really just involves cooking anything over an open fire, I mean like a legit pulled pork sandwich.  In the middle of downtown Joensuu, there is a man from Florida that cooks up some serious Texas-style barbecue.  I was tempted to run around with my sandwich introducing everyone to the deliciousness of real BBQ so they could see what they’d been missing out on all this time.  Instead, I sat in the scorching sun with BBQ sauce all over my face and for a moment I felt like I was back in Texas.  Funny how food can do that to you (<em>or is that just me?</em>)                    </p>

<p>Hyvää Vappua! Happy May Day! We&#39;ve had quite the busy week over here celebrating.  Vappu is the second biggest holiday celebration in Finland (first being Midsummers).  I&#39;ve never seen so many people out in Joensuu – I didn&#39;t even know that many people lived here.  Although May Day is officially May 1st, the festivities ran throughout the entire week.  We started the week with the <em>flying flags</em> event at the university, where we each wrote about our experiences in Finland on the back of our country&#39;s flag.  Then we let them go together to demonstrate what the exchange students bring to Finland.  The next day we went on a bus tour of Eastern Finland.  We stopped at various places to explore and socialize, then we were back on the bus to the next stop.  On Vappu Eve there was a parade of students from the university to an island across town.  In Finland, all students have different colored jumpsuits according to their major.  They collect badges from different events that they take part in and cover their jumpsuits in them.  On special occasions (Vappu being one) all the people that have graduated from basic school (high school) wear their graduation caps proudly.  It&#39;s really a big deal to be able to show off your cap.  After the parade, people gather at the island where there is music playing and they hang out with their friends.  People continue partying wayyy into the night, since the next day is a national holiday.  On the actual day (May 1st), everyone gathers in the city center where there are vendors selling May Day balloons and streamers, a vintage car parade and plenty of socializing.  As the day goes on, people begin to make their way  to the island to have a picnic with their friends and family.  Although it wasn&#39;t exactly picnic weather, <em>I&#39;m talking 35 degrees</em>, we enjoyed spending time eating with our friends.  All the Vappuu activities may have gotten in the way of a little school work this week, but I can&#39;t miss out on the culture, right?  </p>

<p>It seems that every time I start to talk about the <em>amazzzzingly</em> wonderful weather in Finland, it comes back to haunt me.  Remember last week when I was raving about how perfect the weather was... well I take it back.  It has snowed at least three days since then.  <em>Not cool, Finland, not cool.</em>  They say that warm weather is coming, but I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.    Yesterday we spent a good amount of time outside, when it suddenly began to snow.  I looked at a Finnish guy near us with what I&#39;m sure was a “<em>you&#39;ve got to be kidding me</em>” face.  And his apt response was, “<em>It&#39;s Finland, what can I say?</em>”.  </p>
