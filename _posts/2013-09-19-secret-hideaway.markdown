One of my new favorite places.  This little tepee hut is just perfect.  It has a fire pit and fire wood all ready to go.  All it’s missing is some sticky marshmallows and melted chocolate.  I can see s’mores in my very near future.  The view is picturesque and the wooden tepee keeps you pretty warm inside.  We stayed a while, read a couple pages in our books and then took a few wrong turns on our way home.  Back to working and studying, I suppose.  But don’t worry, little tepee in the woods, we will be back soon enough.

(I hope that this has made you want to visit here too because this was, in fact, a shameless ploy to attract visitors.)
