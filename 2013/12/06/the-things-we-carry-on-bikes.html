<p>(And some pictures along the way.)  Lately we&#39;ve been transporting some abnormal things on our bikes.  Well mostly my bike because of it&#39;s awesome abilities with the basket and all.  Riding with a rug in your basket or stools on the back are a little tricky in themselves, but what makes it even more challenging is manuvering through the snow with these things.  The day that beat them all (<em>by far</em>) was the day we went to get the stools.  We decided that we needed a little more seating in our apartment and since we had people coming over the next day it seemed like the perfect time to buy some.  That day there just so happened to be a blizzard going on outside.  It seemed like as good of a day as any and the snow wasn&#39;t going to be letting up any time soon, so we just bundled up and headed out.  At first the snow is kind of enchanting, but not too far in you start to feel like tiny frozen needles are piercing your eyeballs and there couldn&#39;t be anything worse.  Except for the fact that it makes seeing almost impossible.  So we proceed to ride, eyes mostly shut, to the store.  At one point I told Scott that my eyelids would probably be frozen shut by the time we got there.  His response - just keep blinking.  After continuous blinking and an immense amount of pedaling, we arrived, both completely covered in snow but our eyes were still in tact.  An obvious progression of thought would be that our current situation makes for a perfect photo op, huh?  That&#39;s what I thought.  And Scott, after the eye rolls and sighs, reluctantly obligied.  After the picture taking, walking back to my bike, I fell (<em>karma</em>).  My first snow fall.  My feet completely came out from under me and my entire body hit the ground.  Bruised knee and all, that may have been the best part of the excursion (<em>after all, there is nothing funnier</em>).  And although the journey was completely grueling and there was a moment where I prayed a helicopter would magically appear and pick us up, when we got home with those two stools it felt like we had just climbed Mt. Everest.  We made it!  Another check off the ole bucket list.  </p>
