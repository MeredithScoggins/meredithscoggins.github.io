<p>Our journey began when our Finnish speaking skills failed us, yet again, and we were forced to walk to the train station in the snow/ice.  An hour pulling/pushing/dragging luagge through the ice qualified as my exercise for the rest of the year.  I was not a happy camper, starting from about three minutes in.  From there it took us a train, a plane, <em>another</em> train (with one transfer), and a bus to get us to this quaint Swiss town, but it was so worth it.  (I&#39;d probably still be at the train station without Scott&#39;s supreme navigating skills).  The people in Adelboden were so friendly and everyone spoke English (small victories).  </p>

<p>In retrospect maybe skiing, with it being Scott&#39;s first time and on some pretty narrow/steep slopes, was not the best honeymoon activity.  (The Swiss definition of <em>easy</em> was a little different than ours).  We spent our first day with me trying really hard to be a good and patient snow board instructor and Scott not really feeling like I was succeeding at that.  Then I took a pretty serious tumble which left me partially crippled the rest of the trip.  At least these will be stories to entertain our children with some day.  </p>
