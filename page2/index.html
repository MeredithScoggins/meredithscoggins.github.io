<p>Russia, and especially St. Petersburg, is full of exciting cultural experiences waiting to be discovered.  In St. Petersburg it seems like around every corner there is something new to see or do.  Although we were there for three weeks, I feel like we barely scratched the surface of what the city has to offer and I’d love to go back someday.    </p>

<p><strong>EAT</strong><br>
<u>Palavani</u>: This place is a Georgian restaurant and wine bar with deeeeelicious food.  I honestly still dream about it.  If you go you have to get the khachapuri, oven baked bread stuffed with cheese.  It’s to die for.  The rest of the food is equally delicious and so are the Georgian wines.  We tried to go back for a second time on our last night and it was closed for a private event.  I don’t know if I’ve ever been so disappointed.  </p>

<p><u>Stolle</u>: We ate here for lunch one day after we went to the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood.  It’s just a short walk away and it’s a good, budget friendly café. They serve different types of Russian pies, both sweet and savory (we got both).  </p>

<p><u>Rada-k</u>: This vegetarian buffet was just a block over from our flat so it was a perfect spot for a quick and easy lunch, that also happened to be darn good food.  Also, very good price for a good amount of food.    </p>

<p>You must make sure to try the famous Russian blinis at one of the many shops around town - they are everywhere, you can’t miss them! </p>

<p><strong>STAY</strong><br>
After a frantic scramble to find a place to stay (after we were already in St. Petersburg) with a kitchen and internet, we ended up with this great <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1544891">airbnb flat</a>.  If you need something for a longer stay, like we did, or you like to have a kitchen to cook in, this is a great option.  It was spacious flat with all the amenities and close to the center of the city, which was exactly what we needed.   </p>

</div>

<p><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>
<u>Hermitage Museum</u>: A must see when in St. Petersburg.  It’s one of the oldest and largest art museums in the world; you could spend weeks in there and not see everything.  Not only is there exquisite art in the museum, the rooms themselves are works of art.  Everything is so ornate you will be left in awe.  Entrance is free for students and children and free for everyone the first Thursday of every month.     </p>

<p><u>Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre</u>:  One of the things on my must-do list, while in Russia, was to see a ballet.  The <a href="http://www.mariinsky.ru/en/">Mariinsky Theatre</a> is the most famous historic theatre in St. Petersburg, which holds ballets, operas and orchestra performances today.  We saw the Shurale ballet while we were visiting and it’s was absolutely amazing.  The theatre is gorgeous, I felt like I had stepped back in time.  If you can afford it, I’d suggest sitting in the first row of the dress circle right next to the Czar’s box.  You will have a great view of everything and will not be disappointed!     </p>

<p><u>Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood</u>:  The first night we arrived in St. Petersburg, another student took us on a walk around the center of town.  It was already dark and we had no idea where we were going so when we turned the corner down one street and looked up to see this magnificent church that we had seen so many pictures of, we were stunned.  Obviously, it’s much better to see it during the day time when you can really take in all the bright colors and get the full effect of its fairly tale-like nature.  The inside is just as amazing, if not more, than the outside.  It’s covered, wall to wall, with mosaics.  If you have time, I’d recommended taking a peek inside.   </p>

<p><u>Summer Garden</u>: This garden is just a short walk from the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood.  It’s worth taking at least a short stroll through to see all the marble statues.  If the weather is nice, it would be a great place to stay and relax for a bit outside.  </p>

<p><u>St. Issac’s Cathedral</u>: Another magnificent cathedral that’s just as breathtaking outside as it is in.  If you’d like, you can also climb to the top for a panoramic view of St. Petersburg! </p>

<p><u>Peter and Paul Fortress</u>: Peter the Great established this fortress to protect the capital city from Swedish attach during the Northern War.  Lots to see around the area!  </p>

<p><u>Pushkin</u>: We took a day trip to Pushkin and it was perfect - it’s definitely worth a trip.  If you want to go into all of the palaces and churches, you’ll probably want to get there early morning so you can do it all.  To get there from St. Petersburg you can take the purple metro line (line 5) to the Pushkinkaya stop.  From there you will walk about 5 minutes to get to the Tsarskoye Selo Railway.  The train costs about 40 rubles round trip, from St. Petersburg to Pushkin.  A bonus is you’ll get to ride in the oldest public railway in Russia.  The railway station itself is a site to see.  If you’re wanting to just stroll around the town, like we did, you don’t need to worry about leaving so early in the morning because after 6:00 pm Catherine’s Park has free entrance.     </p>

<p>If you’re looking for something to take home with you, the <a href="http://souvenirboutique.com/">Souvenir Boutique</a> has lots of good quality options.  There are other souvenir shops all of over town, seriously everywhere, but I thought that this one seemed to be much better quality, since most of the items are handmade.</p>

<p>Pushkin, what a enchanting little town.  It is named after one of Russia’s most famous poets, Alexander Pushkin, who spent many years studying there.  The town itself is full of history, palaces and parks.  We took a day trip from St. Petersburg on the oldest railway in Russia and spent our time wandering around, admiring the colors and grand buildings, on the most perfect fall day.  As we were strolling around one of the parks, we started to notice everyone carrying around bunches of leaves.  Soon we saw that they were using them to make autumn leaf crowns to celebrate the season.  It’s not a holiday or a formal celebration, just a fun activity that people like to do during this time of year.  One nice woman made our day by letting us try on her crown for just a minute!  It’s the little things in life.  And I&#39;m easily amused.    </p>

<p>Our trip to St. Petersburg came about through my teaching practice.  Our partner university is in Russia, so the program was designed so that our second practice would take place there.  I found out about this trip at our first program meeting when we got to Finland.  It had been a crazy, whirlwind of a week trying to get settled in a new country so I was a little taken aback when I heard about it (and not in a good way).  I wasn’t even used to this whole idea that I was going to be living in Finland for the next two years and <em>you’re sending me to Russia??</em>  Needless to say, it was just my overwhelmed, irrational self that freaked out a bit in that moment and I soon built up lots of excitement about the trip.  </p>

<p>I’m a planner at heart.  I love looking forward and making plans about what we’re going to do, where we’re going to go and how we’re going to do it.  Checking things off my to-do lists - yep, it’s the best.  I realize that sometimes I do this to a fault and this was one of those times that I was forced to learn that lesson the hard way.  I was ready to start checking things off my list in January (and we weren’t going until October), but some of the other people, the ones that could make things happen, did not seem to share my urgency.  In fact, they had quite the opposite plans.  They were going to wait until the very last minute to issue all the paperwork so we could apply for our visas.  <em>It stresses me out just thinking about it again.</em></p>

<p>So there we were, a little over a month away from our trip, applying for our visas in Helsinki.  And we were prepared.  From previous experience with visa applications we knew that we needed to double and triple check all the required documents so that everything would go smoothly, and we did.  We’re standing there, in the application office, in front of the woman carefully checking all of our stuff, holding our breath.  Then it came - <em>ok, everything is ready, your visas will be sent to you be next week.</em>  What WHAT!!  We left the office, fist pumping the air and high fiving like we had just won the lottery.  <em>We did it, we’re going to Russia!!</em> Then reality quickly set in and I realized that we had left our passports in the office.  So we casually knocked on the door and informed the lady that we had accidentally left our passports with her.  <em>Yes, and I will send them back to your next week.</em>  Hm.  Now that’s going to be a problem.  You see, we are leaving tomorrow on a little trip to Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England and Ireland…and I think they’re going to want us to have our passports.  And just like that we were walking out, with all of our documents in hand, and told to come back when we could leave our passports.  All our hard work right down the drain…at least for another month.  </p>

<p>Obviously, because I am writing about our trip, we were successful in finally getting our visas and everything else slowly but surely fell into place.  The three weeks we spent in St. Petersburg were full of all kinds of confusing, unfamiliar, and unforgettable moments, but my favorite one of all was eating with babushka.  One Sunday afternoon one of the girls in my program took us to her grandparents flat outside of St. Petersburg for a traditional Russian meal.  I was pretty pumped about the whole thing because I love trying local cuisine, especially when it’s home-cooked.  On our bus ride there, we were warned that her grandparents didn’t speak any English.  The only words I knew in Russian were hello, thank you and goodbye, which wasn’t going to get us very far.  When we walked into the very small, modest flat, we were immediately greeted by a huge smile and lots of words that we didn’t understand.  She ushered us into the living room which clearly had been set up with a nice table setting just for us.  The conversation started slow, with introductions and basic questions you ask when meeting someone new, and my new friend translating everything we said to each other.  And then came the food, and with that a flood of conversation and laughter around the table.  Babushka (Russian for grandmother) led the conversation and instigated fits of laughter with everything she said.  At one point she asked Scott what he did for a living and he responded, not going into detail, that he worked with computers for a U.S. company.  <em>Soooo, you’re a spy?!</em>  she asked, with a sly smile on her face.  <em>Babushka!!</em> - my friend immediately scolded her and we all had a good laugh.  By the end of our time there we had accumulated hand knit socks, a traditional Gzhel ceramic horse and one of her beloved postcards of Russian art.  It was so special.  I will never forget how warm and generous she was, inviting strangers into her home and spoiling us with delicious food and showering us with gifts.  And I will always think of her when I am curled up on the couch in my multi-colored socks.   </p>

<p>I’m back!  To Finland and to blogging.  With the last several months of travel, family and friends, updating the blog got pushed to the back burner.  But with our return to Finland, we’re starting to get back into the swing of things.  </p>

<p>I have several travel posts which have gotten backed up, starting with Geneva.  Three weeks after we got back from Ireland we left to meet our good friends, Kendall and Will, on the tail end of their Europe trip.  It was just a brief stay in Geneva, but so so worth it.  You can go anywhere with these people and have the time of your life, they seriously make everything fun.  But this city, <em>wow</em>, gorgeous.  Everything was postcard worthy.  Well, everything besides the red-light district, where we stayed.  Let me explain.  When we were looking for a place to stay, months before, we looked everywhere.  Geneva is not exactly the cheapest place in the world, so we scoured the internet to find a place in our budget.  Kendall <em>finally</em> found one, sent it to all of us to approve, we checked it out, looked good, so we booked it.  So then it’s about a month away, Scott and I are sitting around in Ireland and I’m suddenly curious about where exactly we are staying when we get to Geneva.  I put the address in my phone and it pinpoints a place in France.  So I double check that I have the address right.  Yep.  <em>Hmmm</em>.  Text to Kendall - <em>Hey, can you send me the address of our hotel because I think I have the wrong one.  It says it’s in France.</em>  Moments later I get a text back - <em>What?!? Mine says that too!</em>  After a frantic search and realization that we could get a refund, we realized that it was on LAKE Geneva.  Turns out that’s not only in Geneva (<em>word to the wise</em>).  Long story short, we found one hotel, IN Geneva, that was within our price range and close to the area that we wanted to be in.  We had a read a little something about there being some <em>ladies</em> around this hotel, but at this point that didn’t even faze us.  So a month later, when we’re walking through the adorable city of Geneva to our hotel, I was immediately a little taken aback when I saw the short shorts (it was definitely not warm enough for those).  And then it came back to me.  <em>Ooooohhhhhh, yeah</em>.  I shot a quick glance at Scott and he knew exactly what I was thinking.  So I guess there are some not so nice areas too, but that’s what gives it character, <em>right</em>?</p>

<p>Now to the pretty parts.  We took the train to Lutry one day for some wine tasting and although it was not exactly what we expected, the town was everything you could wish for in a little Swiss town.  Despite our best efforts to research before we went, we didn’t have a ton of information about how thing whole wine tasting thing was supposed to work here.  One tip we read said that we should just go around knocking on doors and asking for wine.  So you can&#39;t blame us if we were a little skeptical about how that was going to go.  When we got to Lutry we took the approach of asking random people on the street and in shops, where we could go to taste wine.  Every response consisted of pointing and <em>ummm, there is a place down/up the street/a couple streets</em>.  So we wandered.  Luckily, Lutry is a great place for aimless wandering.  It’s a small town right on the lake with breathtaking views.  <em>What more could you ask for?</em>  Wine.  We came for wine.  So we continued our search.  On one of the final tips from a friendly shop owner, we found what I’ll equate to a wine tasting room.  We walked up to the bar, expecting a set tasting that we could order, and found no such thing.  So we proceeded to describe to the bartender what we were looking for.  <em>Oh, I can do that</em> - was the response.  <em>Perfect</em>.  So we sat and waited for the wines.  He came, placed the wine glasses on the table, and very kindly described them for us and answered all of our questions.  Then when he left we looked at each other.  There were three wine glasses, with three different wines, and there were three of us.  Not to be picky here, but we are just used to getting a “tasting” each, which means each person gets to taste several wines.  So we politely asked the bartender if we could have two more, as in tastings.  He looked at us, furrowed his brow, paused for a second, and said (in a tone that was confused by the ridiculousness of the request) <em>why don’t I just bring you some more glasses so you can split the wine?</em>  Oh, yes, of course, that’s a much better idea.  <em>Crazy Americans</em>.         </p>

<p>The rest of the time was just blah.  You know, like boat rides, hiking, delicious fondue, more wine, that kind of stuff.  I won’t bore you with all the details.    </p>

<p><strong>EAT</strong><br>
Everything we ate in Ireland was pretty heavenly.  We spent most of our time in small towns so there were only a limited number of restaurants to pick from, but I don’t think you can go wrong.  Seafood on the west coast is abundant.   </p>

<p><u>The Long Dock</u> (in Loophead): This the restaurant that we were looking for when we ran into the cute little Irish children riding their bikes.  They serve tons of locally caught seafood.  The seafood chowder is uh-mazing (Scott ate seafood chowder at every restaurant we went to and he vouches for this).  Make sure to check out their craft beer list!  </p>

<p><u>Ashe’s Bar &amp; Restaurant</u> (in Dingle): Another great seafood restaurant in the heart of Dingle (embrace the seafood).  The first time we tried to go for lunch and it was packed, which is always a good sign.  We made sure to come back extra early the next day to get a table.  If you order the lobster they take you over to their tank and let you pick out which lobster will end up on your plate!  </p>

<p><u>Idas Restaurant</u> (in Dingle): This would be a great choice if you were in the mood for a slighter fancier (and more expensive) restaurant.  If you get there before 6:00 you can order from their early bird menu, so I would recommend making plans for an early meal if you’re going for dinner (this was not a problem for my dad).   </p>

<p><strong>STAY</strong><br>
The west coast of Ireland is all about the B&amp;B’s.  You can find some really great, affordable places in all of the small towns. Plus, you get to enjoy a traditional Irish breakfast and get insider tips from the owners.</p>

<p><u>Waters Edge B&amp;B</u> (in Kilkee):  We started out with this winner of a Bed and Breakfast on our first night.  The inside is so cute and the rooms are fantastic.  It looks out over the water so you get to fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean.  Kilkee is a really small town so you only have to walk about 10 minutes to get to the few restaurants and shops in town.  We only stayed one night here and we spent most of the day in Loophead, which is definitely worth the trip.         </p>

<p><u>Duin House B&amp;B</u> (in Dingle): The couple that owns this B&amp;B was so warm and welcoming.  They greeted us with tea and crumpets (I don’t really even know what crumpets are, I just couldn’t <em>not</em> call them that).  They provided us with maps and gave us great recommendations of things to do while we were in Dingle.  The rooms have everything you need AND there are sheep next door.  So you will awake with a lovely wake up call from the sheep (it really adds to the whole experience).    </p>

<p><u>Ocean View B&amp;B</u> (in Cahersiveen): This B&amp;B was nothing fancy, but was perfect for a one night stay.  We arrived too early for check-in, but our host was very accommodating and gave us some suggestions of things to do for the next few hours.  </p>

<p><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>
<u>Kilkee &amp; Loophead</u>: We didn’t actually do much other than eat in Kilkee.  We mainly chose to stay there because it seemed to have more options and was a bigger town than Loophead.  The main attraction here is the Loophead lighthouse and cliffs.  We chose to stop here instead of Cliffs of Moher because it was more on our route and I read than it had less of a tourist crowd.  It was humbling experience to stand on the edge of the cliffs, looking down at the vast ocean.  You can also take a short tour of the lighthouse where you will learn about its history and how it is still in use today.  While you’re in Loophead, take a walk through the town and have lunch at one of the family owned restaurants.  If you’re staying in Kilkee, you could just take a half day to explore the town of Loophead.  </p>

<p><u>Dingle</u>: This was the biggest town that we stayed in on the coast and the one that we spent the most time in.  We spent about two days here, which seemed to be just the right amount of time to get a good taste of the town.  The first day we drove along the “Dingle Way”, which is a big loop around the area with several points of interest along the way.  You could easily spend an entire day on this, taking your time at all the different points along the way.  There’s so many places on the drive when the view changes and you’ll just want to stop to take it all in.  </p>

<p>The town of Dingle is really cute too.  There’s many different art galleries and craft shops that you’ll want to take a peek in.  We probably spent half a day just walking around looking at everything.  Also, this area of Ireland is one of the most highly populated areas of Irish speakers.  (We learned that outside of Ireland the language is called Gaelic, but within Ireland they refer to it as Irish).  If you’re driving along the Atlantic coast, I highly recommend spending some time in Dingle. </p>

<p><u>Cahersiveen</u>: Valentia Island is just off the coast of Cahersiveen, which has some good hiking and sightseeing.  It was really foggy the morning that we went so we didn’t get to see as much as we would have liked, but what we did see was incredible.  The other thing that we would have <em>really</em> liked to do was hike Skellig Michael.  Skilling Michael is another small island in the Atlantic Ocean where a Christian monastery was founded somewhere between the 6th and 8th centuries.  The island itself is highly affected by the wether conditions in the Atlantic, which is why we were unable to go while we were there.  It’s not an experience for everyone, as the hike up the rock seems to be pretty intense.  But if you’re looking for an adventure, and the boats are running while you’re there, you should look into it.  I still want to go back there someday.  </p>

<p><strong>EXTRAS</strong><br>
Rent a car.  From what I’ve read and seen, there’s not a very extensive public transportation system in Ireland, especially along the coast.  It makes life so much easier because you decide when you want to move on to the next town and when you need an extra few hours.  If you’re not used to driving on the left side of the road, it will take some getting used to, but completely do-able (so I’ve heard, I didn’t actually do the driving).  Take the scenic route from town to town, there’s some incredible view along the way where you’ll want to stop and take pictures or just rest for a bit.  </p>
